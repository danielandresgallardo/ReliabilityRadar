    "selftext": "Hey, are you a licensed mechanic? **We appreciate you**, and want to make it so you stand out from the crowd. That's why we're offering custom flair to mechanics now! Just send the mods a [mail message ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/Cartalk)with a photo of your certs, with the personal information blocked out, and include in the photo with a handwritten note that has your reddit name and today's date on it. We will review and update your flair with a super special custom mechanic flair. Want to help mod the sub? Message us about that as well. We're open to getting active people with good car knowledge on board. Just like if you were a mechanic, you'll be severely underpaid ($0/yr) and will get to interact regularly with people who can be crass and impolite. We're looking to add at least three more mods at this time. Don't worry, we won't tell the Snap-On guy where you're working now. Happy New Year!",

Personally I think I should keep it, it only needs a little work, my biggest worry is the transmission it has a certain way you need to drive to keep it happy. In the three years I've had it, it only broke down once, which was about two weeks from when it was giving me signs something wasn't right. And even though it did break down it still ran decent enough for me to drive it over to autozone to fix it. I'm honestly split, on one side it's been an amazing truck and always fulfilled its role. One the other I know it's got 300k miles on the original power train. What say you reddit people?",

If it were me? Assuming no frame (etc.) problems, I'd start by checking out whether that fender can be replaced easily by one from an self-serve auto-wrecker. But I doubt it. It *might* be possible to intentionally cut the rusted parts off, cut the corresponding good parts off of one from the wrecker, and do a swap; then weld, fill, prime, paint, clear coat. Going the other route by trying to fix what's there, I'd still use a welder to replace some of the metal rather than trying to build it all back with putty alone. Realistically? Chip & sand off as much rust as you can, mask it off, spray it with several coats of rust paint, and keep an eye on it.",

About a month ago, I had the oil level checked and it was fine. Today on the highway, I noticed the car was vibrating hard and I couldn’t get past 90 km/h. The check engine light came on. I pulled over and saw that the oil level was extremely low — almost nothing showing on the dipstick. I added oil right away (I didn’t notice any leaks under the car), but when I restarted the engine, it was vibrating badly and making a clicking or ticking noise. Over the next hour, I had to restart the car a few times to move it, and the noise and vibrations gradually went away. Now, it seems to be better. A mechanic will see the car tomorrow, but I’m scared he’ll tell me the engine is toast. Do you think the engine could still be okay? Or should I prepare for the worst?

    "selftext": "Hi all, I have a Volvo 740 -1987 with the B200K engine (carbureted, manual choke). I've been noticing some jerky behavior when driving, specifically in low gears: When I let off the gas and coast using engine braking (especially in 1st or 2nd gear), and then press the throttle again, the car jolts or \"jerks\" briefly before smoothing out. It's like a hesitation or harsh transition between deceleration and acceleration. This doesn't happen in higher gears like 4th or 5th — it's mainly noticeable in the lower ones. Some additional context: * The idle is usually stable around 800–850 rpm, but sometimes when approaching a stop and letting off the gas, the idle drops too low (around 500–600 rpm). A quick blip of the throttle brings it back to normal. * The carburetor has been adjusted previously and emissions were fine during inspection. * The choke is fully manual, and I’m sure it’s fully disengaged when warm. Possible causes I’ve considered: * Drivetrain slack (like in the driveshaft, u-joints, or diff bushings) * Slight carburetor delay or mixture transition * Weak or worn engine/trans mounts * Ignition timing or mixture slightly off * or maybe its just \"feature\" of an old rwd car Has anyone experienced similar behavior on a carbureted Redblock engine or older Volvo in general? I'd appreciate any suggestions or insight. Thanks in advance!",

Inspected my car a little bit and noticed a couple of issues with my brakes, serpentine belt/tensioner, suspension. Its 2005 golf 5 plus 1.6fsi. I drive maybe 30kms each weekend. Its my first car, so I dont want to baby it. Just want to keep it roadworthy, safe and dont want to neglect it. Im adding a bunch of photos and a couple of videos. 1. As I understand, I need new brake discs, that for sure. In theory I could keep the brake pads, but since they are contaminated with all the rust and junk from the rotors, it would be wise to change the pads too? Plus I dont understand if brake calipers are done, or are they fine? https://imgur.com/a/mIWcRFr 2. I dont know what this rusty part is, but I tapped it with iron rod and it doesnt sound hollow. To me it seems like surface rust. Should I brush it with wire brush to be sure, or something? https://imgur.com/a/M0YZuSo 3. When buying the car I was told that the engine consumes oil. So I always was just adding the oil and checking its level regularly. I noticed that the bottom of the engine is covered with (fresh ?) oil. So I guess the engine does not burn it, but it just leaks it in this place. I know that there are some cases when engine really burns the oil and adding the oil to it is cheaper option instead of fixing the root cause. Is that the case? https://imgur.com/a/qmr1BoY 4. I took a look at the car suspension (tried googling how this part is called exactly, but no proper info on it). That thing that absorbs road bumps (coil, strut, absorber, idk). The rear ones have a little bit of rust on the rubber. And the front ones have some rust at the bottom of the springs. How much life these things at the front have left? https://imgur.com/a/79Nft7E 5. No idea how this part is called in english, but I see some rust on it, some flaking of black paint, but it sound solid. As I understand, its fine? https://imgur.com/a/fpQHzhl 6. Lower control arms in the front are fine too? https://imgur.com/a/h1w1qNp 7. When starting a car theres a high pitched chirping sound. How to diagnose it? Is it one the pulleys, tensioner, loose belt, worn belt? https://imgur.com/a/S4Fg8Cq How to check other parts of my suspension, drivetrain? How to know what parts should move and what parts shouldnt? Thank you so much for any help !",

        "body": "1. They don't look great, but if all the brake pads have about that much material left, and the car is stopping alright, you can let it go for a while longer. Eventually you want to replace the pads, rotors, knock the rust of the calipers and brackets so they can move, and flush the brake fluid. 2. That's the steering knuckle and it has normal surface rust, which is best left alone. You'll want to learn how to check ball joints, tie rod ends, and wheel bearings to see if those need attention. YouTube will have videos on the subject. 3. It all depends on where the oil leak is as for the difficulty of the fix. The most common leak is valve cover gaskets. Oil runs downhill of course, so if you can wipe just below the valve cover and find fresh oil, that's the starting point and you need a new valve cover gasket. What I can see of the oil pan seal looks alright. Every engine has multiple seals and gaskets to hold the oil in, and any one of them can fail. If you're not having any results looking for the leak, try degreasing the engine and see where the oil comes back first. 4. That picture didn't load but I'll assume you're taking about coil springs. Surface rust is fine. A broken coil spring is not. You can try bouncing each corner of the car to decide if the suspension needs work, and again, YouTube videos can show you what to look for, and you can judge how the car handles after going over a pothole or bump. 5. That's the axle, or \"half-shaft\" and it looks like surface rust. Generally that black rubber boot will fail first, and throw grease all over everything near. There is a boot at each end of the shaft. When the boot fails you need a new axle. If you can catch it in time it's possible to just change the boot but it's messy and time consuming. 6. Also surface rust. When the ball joints and bushings start to fail, you can replace the whole control arm. 7. Usually that is due to worn bearings in an idler pulley. Could also be the belt tensioner, or the belt itself. Best practice is to replace the idler pulley(s), and belt tensioner when you replace the belt. You can use a mechanics stethoscope to hunt for the source of the noise when the engine is running, but it's hard to get to some parts. Or, with the engine off, remove the belt and try spinning the idler pulleys. They should turn free and not wobble, and if they don't spin easy or wobble, you need new a new pulley.",

Look for \"Color Code\" or \"Paint Code\" followed by letters and/or numbers. 2.Purchase the correct touch-up paint: Get one that matches your car's specific paint code. You can often find these at auto parts stores (e.g., AutoZone, O'Reilly, Advance Auto Parts in the US; similar stores exist globally), online retailers (Amazon, eBay), or sometimes even at your car dealership (though dealerships tend to be slightly more expensive for the same product). 3. Clean it, with a microfiber cloth or any good cloth, use a little alcohol but not to much as to not damage the paint 4.Apply the color paint: Shake the pen/bottle well. For a thin scratch, use the pen tip or the very edge of the brush to apply a very thin layer of paint into the scratch only. Avoid painting outside the scratch as much as possible..Let the first layer dry for 10-15 minutes (or as per product instructions). Apply another thin layer if needed to fill the scratch. The goal is to build up the paint slightly above the surrounding surface, as it will shrink slightly as it dries. 5. (Optional) apply a thin layer of clear coat and let it dry and cure for about 24/48 hours 6. (Optional) you can polish it",

    "selftext": "So I have a situation with my tires, and I'm prepared to hear the hundreds of differing opinions on the matter. For context, I'm due for the NYS annual inspection, and one of the areas they check are tires. The first picture is the damage to the back rear tire, and I'll say I plan to replace this anyway. However, both out of curiosity and in the unlikely event that I cannot get it replaced before the inspection, would it pass inspection as is? The second question is when I replace the tires, which ones should I replace (conventional wisdom says replacing two at a time is best). The second picture shows minor damage to the front tire, inclining me to replace that one in addition to the more damaged rear tire. My main debate at the moment is which tires to replace and where they should all end up. For the record, these tires are on a GTI (which is front wheel drive), and the tires are worn very evenly from inside to out. Both front tires are at 6/32, and both rears are at 8/32 (each across the whole width of the tire, my alignment is on point). The question is should I: 1. Replace the two rear tires (including the one in the first pic), to maintain the tread height the same across the axle (and painfully, replacing one undamaged tire at 8/32) or, 2. Replace the two pictured tires (understanding the damage on the front is minimal), replacing one from the front and one from the back. And in that case, where should I mount the new tires? I know conventional wisdom says to mount them on the back to prevent oversteer, but I would rather them be on the front, as being a front wheel drive car, the front wears significantly quicker. I would also like to avoid having a significant difference in tire tread across the front driven axle to reduce stress on the differential, although if I put a new tire on the front passenger side and rotate the intact rear tire to the front the difference in tread depth would only be 2/32. Now, I would rather have this tread difference on the back, installing both new tires in the front (against conventional wisdom) and bringing the undamaged front tire to the rear, so that the rear (undriven) axle has one tire at 6/32 and one at 8/32. A tread depth difference of 2/32 across the undriven axle is practically negligible, but again out of sheer curiosity, how long would that take to even out? I could also reverse this arrangement, placing the two new tires on the rear following conventional wisdom and have a tread depth difference of 2/32 across the driven axle (which is the maximum allowable difference across a driven axle for most VAG cars). Worst case scenario is I replace the two damaged tires and leave them where they are, in which case I would have a tread difference of 4/32 in the front (which I would really rather avoid), and 2/32 in the back. I know I'm nitpicking here, and ultimately the differences are quite small. But since I have the time and free will to write this out and entertain the debate, here I am. Apologies for the giant wall of text, and I welcome all reasonable opinions. TIA! **TL;DR:** Front at 6/32, rear at 8/32. Damage to rear and front driver side tires (pictured, respectively). Which 2 tires to replace and what positions should all the tires end up in?",

So now my hood/front of my car has this section where the paint got scraped and looks ugly. A) Is this something I can fix ideally relatively inexpensive? Dont need a price or anything but tips on getting it done myself, if it would be not crazy expensive I'd like to try.

If the coolant was really old the cooling system could be a rusty mess. Need to go through the brakes and flush the brake fluid. If it was really old you may need lots of new parts in the brake system as brake fluid attracts moisture and when left to sit that moisture wreaks havoc. Fuel may have deteriorated. Fuel pump likely has already failed or will fail quickly if it did. Tires need to be replaced if they're over 7 years old or dry rotted.

I have always respected people working on their car and the \"Project car\" term in general, but I have zero respect for douches like this.) The car seems to be a VW Golf Mk5. Around 15-20 years old, dirt cheap on the second hand market, considered a good option as a project car. Lowered suspension and loud exhaust kit are the obvious modifications, but if I know anything about these type of dudes, it also has a lot of \"rice\" accessories. To make it short, this douchebag took that nice project car and turned into a douchemobile. The actual reason why somone does this is because they hate someone in the neighbourhood and they want to annoy them. However their raw gasoline-infested brain cannot perceive the fact that there are numerous other people living in the area. In some other countries this act usually ends up with some sleepy-eyed angry dudes using the driver's body to redecorate the car, but you live in a civilized world and your only option is to call the police on them.",

    "selftext": "So a few weeks ago or maybe 1-2 months ago my oil pressure light started to come on. It was very inconsistent but was mostly triggered by high RPM but not always. At first it just started blinking and then gradually turning into being on at all times. Sometimes I had it fora 2-3 days in a row sometimes I didnt have it for a week. The engine was running completely fine otherwise for weeks. Now at some point the check engine light came on with it and there is no turbo boost which is probably related but the car still runs fine otherwise. No weird noise, no overheating engine, nothing besides the turbo boost. When this first appeared I drove it for 1-1,5 week and changed the oil as it was time for it anyways and it was a bit higher then the maximum and the oil seemed normal. No particles or anything in it. Now I know im an idiot for driving the car like this but I had no option. Now im looking more into what this could be and im wondering if this can just be a faulty sensor since the only thing that happened during this long time is the loss of turbo boost (which might even be unrelated since I think it was on its way out anyways). Am I right to think this is most likely just the sensor or can other issue be this \"harmless\" regarding the oil pressure light? I feel like my engine would be cooked after driving it for so long with actual bad oil pressure but i dont know enough about the subject to say for sure.",

The cars got a Sports cat, BFB diverter valve and a induction kit, I know the prince engines were also used in the THP200/Mini cooper S doing about 220 bph after remap. Does the part above the 5500 rpm look like a flow restriction or the turbo capping out? I can source a turbo from a thp200 (or 208 GTI etc) that are larger and produce more boost and are a straight bolt on. Would the car be able to run normally without having to get it remapped again, or would I have to get it remapped right away as I'm planning on upgrading the intercooler and exhaust as well before the map?",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I’m trying to get some outside perspectives here. What would you do in my situation? I have a 2008 ford expedition el king ranch 4x4 with 150k miles that I inherited almost 10 years ago. It’s been our family road trip truck and we love it. After our last trip, just when we arrive home, the check engine light came on. Local mechanic quoted $6k of work needed including: early fuel evap canister w/solenoid, serpentine belt, 2 heater hoses, cooling system service, both valve cover gaskets, schrader valve and AC system service, both upper suspension control arms and joints, alignment, and new tires. That quote doesn’t include the extra diagnostics for the rear air suspension leak and that fix, as well as differentials and transfer case service. The rear axles are also seeping - we were told we could just keep an eye on it but I’m concerned of those being a possible safety issue and mounting damage. We worry if we spend this money, probably being $8000 or more, then something else may soon break and we’d have spent all that money just to have to replace the vehicle anyway or spend another however many thousands to continue fixing it. We had planned a national park tour for this summer and fall, and planned on using the truck to tow a smaller travel trailer (the truck has the HD tow package and we understand payload and all that). This really threw a wrench in the plans. Newer comparable expeditions we’ve looked at are about $35-40k with ~50-70k miles and most all are out of warranty, so if anything went wrong, we’d have an $800 monthly payment (~10% apr, which is ridiculously high) and then have the potential to pay for any repair that’s needed if it happens. I’ve read the newer expeditions are having engine, transmission, and brake problems which is especially concerning for us buying it used and driving it around in the mountains/rural areas/towing. Also, if we take that monthly payment for a newer car, we’d have to trade in our other car that we’re making payments on ~$500/month) since we don’t feel comfortable with almost $1500 monthly in car payments. This would then leave us with only 1 car - not a *major* inconvenience as my husband works remotely and I’m home with the kids, but I will be going to grad school next year. Neither situation is great, but I’d love if anyone can give some input. Thanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/s/pp5h9etKLR Quick update from my post last week: I installed a new alternator (took ~2 hours, no issues). The old one was covered in oil, so I need to replace the oil gasket. Problem is, the new alternator didn’t fix the voltage issue. It still drops to 11.5v, and maxes out around 13.5v. Weirdly, if I turn on the blower (low) or headlights, it stays steady at 13.3–13.5v. Is it safe to drive like this if it holds in the 13v range under load? So now I’m looking at: - Bad oil gasket - Maybe a bad ELD? - New battery (1 month old) - New alternator (1 day old) I’ve driven an hour using the blower trick with no battery light. Planning to take it to a shop next week for a deeper electrical/fuse box check. Any advice appreciated.",

    "selftext": "I have a 2017 Nissan murano sl. Got the trans fluid done 2 weeks ago, they told me to come back the next weekend the filter wasn’t in on time so they still had to replace it. I came in last weekend got the filter done, and otw home I was on the highway when I heard thumping. Initially thought I blew a tire but when I got out I saw the skid plate under my car was dragging. My brother came to help n said the car didn’t have any clips holding it up. Next day he got some clips and put it back up, but said I was still missing a few. Brought my car back to the shop today (third weekend in a row now) they put the clips back in but said half the skid plate broke off. They told me they didn’t have to touch the skid plate for the fluid or filter and that I prob hit something that caused it to break. The thing is, the plate wasn’t damaged at all (or at least I have never had a shop mention it to me and the other shop I bring my car to tells me legit EVERYTHING) so I don’t think it was previously damaged so why would it just fall off?? Idk I don’t believe they didn’t touch the plate, I watched a video on YouTube and it looks like they remove it for the filter but idk I’m not a mechanic and I also work with this girl (it’s her bfs shop) so I don’t want to accuse them if maybe the plate was broken? Idk I’m just finding it hard to believe when it was legit hours after I left the shop. Idk someone please give me advice I’m waiting for them to tell me how much a new plate will be.",

I played Spotify songs on my old phone now this one isn’t working but it is connected both via Bluetooth and aux cable. It isn’t the cord as it’s brand new and worked with the old phone. I have checked settings, turned on accessories on my phone, and still nothing. Kind of frustrated. TIA!",

    "selftext": "So I have a 05 dodge ram 1500 5.7 hemi my engine light was on and blinking while driving home from work I stopped at a stop sign and went to go and the truck stalled out I keep trying to turn it back on it was cranking but not starting. So I had to call a tow and had them bring it to my normal shop to fix it mind you been going been going there forever but his son is taking over and now the shop is terrible… they called said it was the fuel pump and they put a new one in an said I was good to go. I go to pick up my truck make it a mile down the road and it stalls out. Called the shop obviously pissed they came and got it and and said the pumps under warranty and they would see what happen… two weeks later when they finally got to it they said it was a faulty pump and they replaced it and I’m good to go.. picked it up drove home noticed the engine light still blinking and some shaking when I hit 50 mph made it home and next day the truck is doing the exact thing again crank no start.. I just paid them $428 to do the pump an I feel like that was never the issue. With money being tight I couldn’t afford to bring it anywhere else or pay another tow so I’m trying to fix this myself. The codes it was throwing p0207 and p03000 and p0113 did some research and checked all my wiring to fuel injector 7 and replaced fuel injector 7 that didn’t work. Also checked wiring to the air temperature sensor and replaced air temperature sensor and that also didn’t work. Along with that I’ve tested the fuel pressure which is completely fine and I hear my fuel pump turn on so I know that’s not it. I also checked my fuses and fuse relay and that wasn’t the issue. I’m honestly starting to feel defeated and pissed that I paid these guys to fix the issue and I’m still here with a crank no start. Never going there again obviously and called and lost my shit on them cause I truthfully need my truck for work and my kids and feel like I got fucked over big time. If you’re still even reading I appreciate any advice of what I should do next or if anyone would know what could cause this.",

IROC edition started in 84 or 85 and ended in 90. But it was the first year for that body style. Pros: 305 yanked out, 350 dropped in. Bored 30 over, making it a 355. Mild cam, flat top pistons. 4 speed Manual Borg Warner transmission (only available in the 82 and half of the 83 model years). Cons: frame rotted out right where the clutch linkage mounts to it. I'm kicking around the idea of getting an '84 or later bell housing for the transmission and converting it to hydraulic clutch, cutting away the rotten parts of the frame and welding it up with plate steel. Otherwise I'm yanking the engine and transmission to put into a third gen in better condition and parting this one out. I feel like the latter is the safer option as no body shop in my area seems too eager to touch it, but I hate to crush a classic. Here's a vid from when I last had it on the road (a couple Japanese guys here on visas working for Honda were fascinated by it and wanted to go for a ride, so I got a bit silly) . I still put a little gas in it and run it in neutral occasionally to keep the engine in decent condition.",

    "selftext": "Alright, I need to get this off my chest and hear some real opinions, because I am genuinely perplexed. The Mini Cooper Countryman. Every time I see one on the road, I just find myself staring, not in admiration, but in confusion. Does anyone genuinely look at that car and think, \"Yes, that's the one for me! I'm trying to be fair here. It's not terrible. I mean, it drives. It has wheels. It has some of that classic Mini styling that a lot of people seem to dig, and the interior can be quirky and distinct, which is a nice break from blandness. But honestly, beyond the aesthetics, I just don't see the compelling argument for its existence, let alone for purchasing one. Here's my ever-growing list of grievances and questions: * It's not that \"mini\" anymore (and that's the whole point, isn't it?): The entire allure of a Mini, historically, was its compact size, its almost kart-like nimble handling, and its uncanny ability to squeeze into tight city spots. It was a unique proposition. The Countryman? It's a small crossover. It's bigger than its siblings, meaning it loses that core \"mini\" identity. It's like going to a steakhouse and ordering a salad you're fundamentally missing the point. * But it's not a proper SUV either: So, it's bigger than a regular Mini. Great. But it's not exactly spacious or rugged like a true SUV. You're not hauling a ton of gear, nor is it going to conquer any off-road trails more challenging than a gravel driveway, now obviously not all SUVs are made to be rugged or taken off road, however it still doesn't have what a regular SUV would. It just feels like it occupies this weird, ill-defined, inbetween space where it's not particularly good at being either a genuinely compact, fun-to-drive Mini or a practical, versatile small SUV. It's the automotive equivalent of a platypus confusing and seemingly stitched together from disparate parts. * The Reliability Elephant in the Room (Thanks, BMW): Okay, let's talk about probably one of the worst qualities. Mini is owned by BMW. And while BMWs are fantastic to drive, their reputation for long-term reliability and wallet friendly maintenance isn't exactly stellar. From what I've seen and heard, especially with earlier Countryman models (thinking 2011-2015 era), engine issues like timing chain failures, high-pressure fuel pump problems, and excessive oil consumption were alarmingly common. And let's not forget the anecdotes of transmission woes or even things like exploding sunroofs While newer models (2020+) are supposedly better, that historical baggage weighs heavily. When you're buying a car known for its \"fun\" factor, you don't expect the fun to stop abruptly with a massive repair bill. * The Cost of \"Fun\" (and then fixing it): This brings me to the absolute clincher: the value proposition. For the price, and let's be real, Mini can get expensive fast, especially when you start ticking option boxes what are you really getting? You're paying premium money for a car that, despite its attempts at being a crossover, often comes with a stiff ride (especially with those dreaded run-flat tires) and a history of potential mechanical headaches. And when those headaches strike, remember that BMW ownership means parts and labor are not \"cheap.\" Routine maintenance is more expensive than average, and a significant repair can set you back thousands. You're essentially paying premium money for something that doesn't quite fit any mold, might break down, and will then cost you an arm and a leg to fix. It's not bad, but it's not great. It's just... there? It feels like a stylistic choice that compromises on practicality, true \"mini-ness,\" and long-term financial sense. It's the car that makes me go, \"Who is this for, exactly?\" Am I missing some secret sauce to the Countryman that I'm just not seeing? Is the driving experience so sublime that it makes up for all these glaring compromises? Or is it purely about the aesthetic and the brand loyalty for those who want a Mini but... bigger? Change my mind, or tell me I'm not alone in this lol.",

I got a new oil change, new transmission fluid, new spark plugs and the car runs and drives great. But since I got it, it has been running rough idle. There is no sign of misfire, just the car shaking alot including the steering wheel on idle and when stopped at a red light in drive. (You can hear the car shaking, its loud) The mechanic also said that I have compression rates of 100, 130, 130, and 130. So cylinder 1 is losing compression. I am quite literally terrified because I have a a feeling thousands of dollars of repairs are coming to the engine. Head gasket has been ruled out, it could be a valve or a piston ring. (The car sat all winter and wasn't driven too much until I bought it, (previous owner cleaned fuel injector recently and there is no rust on the car at all) (I have not yet done a leakdown test because If I hear the results and its as bad as I hoped, I will probably regret everything but I will do one in the next 2 weeks for sure) Anyone have any ideas or help?",

After that I notice the check engine light went off even though I did nothing to fix the issue. The P0017 check engine light only seems to appear when the engine is cold but once it’s been running for a good while and even if I stop and start the engine again the code will not appear at all. Seems to only be a cold start. Would this indicate the old oil causing this code to appear? My thoughts because once the oil is at temp the code stop’s appearing because it’s flowing easier.

I've been doing my own oil changes for a little while now, and I think I need to start disposing of all the used motor oil that I have tucked away. This whole time I've been putting them into empty laundry detergent jugs and setting them aside. I'm really not sure why but I've been avoiding dropping them off at Advance Auto, AutoZone, etc. but I have. Does anyone know if there's a specific container that I need to use for drop off or is what I'm using now OK? Thanks!",

The filter IS NOT the restriction preventing your engine from making more power. Yes K&N media flows more air than paper filter media, in a lab test hooked up to perfect clear plastic tubing; but on an engine dyno, the filter itself is basically transparent to the engine. You can run back to back to back tests with a paper filter, K&N, and NO filter, and see absolutely no difference, assuming you make no other changes. It's been done and proven countless times. K&N got the reputation for making power at best because people were replacing restrictive air intake systems with open filter elements. The whole \"buy it once and reuse it forever\" thing is a false economy unless your OEM-replacement paper air filters are unusually expensive. I calculated that for my daily driver the breakeven point of a K&N is somewhere around 300,000 miles, depending on how many cleanings I could get out of the cleaning kit.

So \"performance\" filters that let in more air, also let in more particles. But the particles are bad for the engine, bad for the turbo and that's generally the whole point of an air filter.

The lack of effective filtering allows smaller particles to pass which, in turn, cause internal wear.

We had a small fleet of 12 corollas bought new and each were maintained the same way at our local dealer, with the exception of three of them had K&N filters put in within the first few hundred miles. By 100,000 those three used significantly more oil than the other 9, and by 150,000 those three all had low compression and serious oil consumption issues. If you only keep a car for a few years or maybe don’t care if it goes past 100,000 miles, you might not notice the ill-effects. But the fact is that they allow more air by filtering less.

    "selftext": "Noticed an oil leak after the 60k maintenance on my girlfriend's 2016 Honda Fit. Some pooling around what I think is the air intake. We took it back to the service center and they identified the issue, one of the valves wasn't pressurized after the service. However, now I'm worried that having driven it lightly for a few weeks we may have damaged it. Is it possible there is lasting damage or are we ok?",

Sometimes the vibrations are minor, other times more noticeable. I’ve tested whether the vibrations are related to the engine, and I can confirm that they still occur even when the car is in neutral, so it seems to be related to the road surface or suspension. * The issue occurs with both sets of wheels, summer and winter The summer tires are brand new (Continental ContiSportContact A0 19-inch) * I’ve replaced all four upper front control arms with Lemförder parts, except one which is a Sidem brand (front passenger side, upper rear) * A wheel alignment was performed after replacing the control arms, which improved handling and reduced some vibration \\> Note -> Only the seats do have vibration, probably from the floor. Steering wheel is fine. I was told by an independent mechanic that the electro-hydraulic engine mount on the passenger side has lost some fluid and should be replaced and then another wheel alignment performed. Another shop advised waiting until the check engine light comes on and then replacing all three mounts, two engine mounts and one transmission mount I’m unsure how to proceed Any help is appreciated",

I can say that on perfectly smooth roads, the seats do not vibrate. However, if the road is bumpy or uneven, the seats start to vibrate. Also, when the car is idling, the seat vibrates consistently, though only at the headrest. If I shift the gear to \"N\" and press the gas pedal (raising the engine RPM above 2000), the seat no longer vibrates. To clarify the IDLE, I am referring to a minor vibration felt only at the head of the seat while IDLE",

He suggested leaving it in as it didn't seem to be leaking. I went to another tire shop on my way home. They lifted the car, sprayed some water and said there's an extremely minor leak. He suggested replacing the tire but said if you don't want to right now just keep filling air if it's losing pressure slowly. Between the time I noticed the nail and driving to the tire shops and coming home, I have driven more than 50 miles and the pressure is still intact. Is there a risk of blowout or an accident? It's a Yokohama yk740 gtx running at about 40k miles with a tread depth of 6. As it's an AWD, I'd have to replace all 4 tires.

So basically what I’m really saying is, it’s gonna cost you quite a bit more to get the specs perfect. If your car doesn’t pull and the steering wheel is straight you’re probably good.

    "selftext": "Throughout most of my life, I have gotten sick inside vehicles quite often. I used to chock it up to motion sickness, but I'm not so certain that is a complete explanation for it. Here are some things I've noticed: * It is pretty exclusive to gas powered vehicles, I've never gotten sick or felt close to getting sick (as will be described later) inside of an EV. * I almost always feel very mildly sick inside of a gas powered vehicle, to the point where I do feel worse than normal but it is often somewhat easy to supress vomiting. * The smell of gas will is the single worst trigger here, and I usually gag (and eventually vomit) if the smell of gas or exhaust fumes inside the cabin is particarly strong. * Another very strong trigger is having the AC on. In the hundreds of models of cars I've been in, having the AC has always made me feel sicker and close to throwing up without fail. * Sudden turns combined with the two factors above is often a trigger * Opening windows usually helps quite alot, but it helps the most when the car is in motion and I can feel the air/wind blowing on me. The best explanation I have for this is likely a combination of motion sickness as a minor factor (since certain turns and such can trigger it) but with the more major factor seemingly being some sort of hypersensitivity to even relatively slight amounts of cabin pollution. When I first rode inside of an EV for the first time, I was shocked to find out just how normal and well I felt compared to every gas-powered car I've been in. Since than, I've been in EVs more and have never felt even remotely sick inside of one. Naturally, I have tried to search some of these (symptoms?) up only to find results that are at best tangentially related to what I am actually looking for. Considering that some of what I experience doesn't seem to be super common from what I can tell, another frustrating thing is that people often don't get or dismiss me when I ask for an accommodation that would lower the risk of me throwing up. Most common example of that is I oftentimes ask the driver for the AC to be turned off or for me to open the window to let some fresh air in, both often times rejected by driver as they want the AC to be on for comfort and opening the window would also impede that. Does anyone here know what I might be experiencing? Again, I don't think motion sickness quite explains it. This also isn't anything new, it's happened for basically as long as I can remember riding inside of a vehicle. Does the explanation I came up with hold any weight? I apologise if some of my terminology is incorrect, I'm not really much of a \"car person\" and thus might not use the correct terms for some things.",

I went out of town recently to visit family and my boyfriend took the car on a little road trip (340 miles each way). Before leaving, he did good on checking fluids, adding coolant, oil level good, etc. Made it there and back just fine. As soon as he was pulling into the driveway, it was hitching and check engine light went on. He checked fluids again and looks like it lost a ton of oil, so he added. He also found out at that point that he had forgotten to put the cap back on the coolant reservoir so he went that whole trip without it. Yikes. So I got home, ordered a cap for the coolant, plug in a scanner and get code P0017 (crankshaft/camshaft position). I jimmy rig a temp. cap for the coolant with a small bag and rubber bands. No more check engine light after that, but the engine now making a whirring sound while accelerating, and after parking, the oil light is blinking on and off. I checked the oil and its at an ok level. So I'm imagining I need a new oil pump, but what is causing the whirring? Is this engine toast? Can't get it in anywhere until Tuesday (damn holiday weekend) so I'm not driving it til then.",

I haven’t noticed any visible signs of leaking ( i park on cement and light coloured pavement so i think i might have noticed by now). i also checked my oil levels and they’re still full. i don’t know if the dealer is trying to scam me or if it’s even as urgent as they’re making it sound. they’ve quoted me $360 aud to get it repaired. any advice would be appreciated. thank you!!",

Whatever kind of car you have spend a couple hours on youtube when you have some free time and just look at videos of miscellaneous repairs to get familiar with what things are and where they are. The crankshafts on the front of the engine. Poke your head under there and see if its actually oily sometime when you get bored. Even if you aren't interested in actually working on cars it pays to be familiar with them so you understand what's actually wrong with them and can verify things for yourself if you ever get sketchy advice.

    "selftext": "Currently pondering which car to keep as I am moving from my hometown to a large city with my fiance. Car A: - ‘08 Honda Civic - 86,XXX miles - Owe $3500, bought two years ago from elderly lady with 50k miles, it’s only ever owner Car B: - ‘14 Chevy Cruze - 83,XXX miles - Paid off, only one prior owner as well My instinct is to sell car A just to not have the payment, but from what i’ve seen, civics will run forever and cruzes have a reputation for its turbos going bad and other stuff a lot sooner. My fiance also drives car B and has a habit of putting the car in drive while still rolling in reverse. (drives me insane, not sure if it actually affects longevity of the car). WWYD? Is the potential difference in longevity worth the $3500 I’d pay to keep Car A? Selling Car B and paying off Car A is also off the table for some long, obnoxious reasons.",

It typically goes to 2000 RPMs and then slowly goes down but it has been going to the 2000 then almost stalling to 1300-1500 and then jumps back up to 2000. There is no dash light on and I just don’t know what the issue could be. I’ll also emphasize that it doesn’t do it on every start up only ones after it sits for a little and that it runs perfectly normal throughout the day. I attached a video of the engine bay and the dash, in the engine bay one you can clearly hear it begin to stall and then go back to normal (ignore the squeaking belt as it got wet from the rain the other night).

I do not know when it happened or why (it’s polarizing to have a big truck these days, I guess) in any case, someone took a knife to the sidewall of the rear wheel. It was deep, but somehow it did not pierce the inner steel belt. Thus, no loss of air pressure. I replaced because sidewall was compromised but hugely impressed with the integrity and strength of the tire. Thank you Kumho.",

    "selftext": "Just bought this 2004 Honda CR-V from a family friend who had it sitting for 6 years. Unbeknownst to me (but unsurprisingly since we live in CA), someone tried stealing the cat but stopped halfway through and left a decent cut in the exhaust before the cat. Wondering what my options are and if it would pass SMOG with the slit in the exhaust. Would the only option here be to drop the exhaust and weld the slit? Is there some sort of temporary fix I can DIY? Any advice appreciated! For those who can provide insight on whether it’s worth to keep and fix or resell to someone else (others are interested still), I paid ~$2.9k for it with 127k miles and AWD, but would potentially be in it for $3.9k with reg backfees before any sort of repairs.",

So my current issue is that the wheels are rubbing on the inner tire wall for the front tires only and every 2 months or less I have to get new ones. I’m looking for some new wheels but I’m struggling to understand certain things. How is my offset listed on the rims 45 but the tire says 40? Am I able to just switch tires like 225/45/18 and it would still fit on the rim and reduce rub ? Very new to all this any help is appreciated. Also forgot to mention I have it lowered on bc coilovers (not lowered in this pic but looks very similar)",

        "body": "Most lower priced Sealed Lead Acid (SLA - which has been the most common automotive battery for a long time) batteries use cheaper materials and/ or have less plates inside to store the energy. The result will be a battery that has the cranking amps needed for a certain application/ application range, but maybe not a great reserve capacity. These can be $80 to maybe $200 (In Canada so adjust for local currency) Higher priced batteries, can be the opposite, or have a different design/ chemical makeup inside; higher end SLA batteries can be better made, and or have more plates, while AGM (Absorbed Glass Mat) batteries are similar they have fiberglass matting between the plates, to absorb the battery acid which has its benefits. Though there are many AGM producers, Optima is more than likely the most recognizable, as they have had a good reputation, and primarily produce AGMs. You may hear mixed reviews of them, but I've had nothing but good experiences with them. Better quality SLAs can be about $200 to $400+ AGMs are becoming more and more popular, for a number of reasons, slowly phasing out the older SLA technologies as the power demand of newer vehicles continues to increase. These are often $300+ Lithium batteries, similar to E-bike batteries or really big phone batteries are also coming into the market which offer very high reliability, faster recharging, sometimes containing smaller Sodium- Ion reserve batteries to boost itself if the Lithium-Ion battery itself dies. Some also have Bluetooth capabilities, and built in battery warmers to keep themselves warm and alive during the cold months. These are $600+ often getting to $1500+ Reserve capacity is to give customers an idea of how long the battery can last outputting a certain amperage. 5Ah would be about 5 Amps for one hour, or 2.5 Amps for two hours, and that rating/ duration can be affected by everything mentioned above. All of these types of batteries will have \"cheaper\", potentially worse quality options, and more expensive, hopefully better quality options. Say your vehicle requires 180 amps to crank in warmer weather and 240 or something to crank while cold, that 5Ah can get used up pretty quickly - whatever that math works out to be... (If I remember correctly, a battery's cranking amps is the amps it can output for 30 seconds above 0⁰C/ 32⁰F and cold cranking is somewhere below those temperatures. If you want more information I could share some more, or the Google AI will tell you most of what you'd want to know if you look up AGM meaning or something similar. This is all from memory, so I could have mistaken some things, but most, if not all of it is accurate enough to give you at least a general idea of what you're wondering.",

Since it has this bump? the visor is unable to stay situated at the top and just kinda droops, cause the bump makes it unable to stay in place.

But it gradually gets more sensitive the longer I drive. I drove maybe 300 miles with these new brakes. So I don't know if this is just to be expected and I just need to be patient until they completely break in or if I did something wrong. It's not a scratching noise like when the pads are worn out but a lower kinda squeak. They are ceramic brakes, average rotors I guess. Does anyone have any tips or words of wisdom?",

    "selftext": "Got a weird misfire issue that started out of nowhere. CEL began flashing right after a highway drive — literally right after I filled up at a gas station, so that might be related. Car drives smoothly during normal cruising, but once I get into it (WOT or higher RPMs), it starts misfiring & starts flashing the check engine light, then turns off in about 5 seconds ONLY when I'm flooring it, NO check engine light on idle at all. Here’s what I’ve done so far: * Replaced **all spark plugs** and **coil packs** * Installed a new **fuel injector in Cylinder 5** (still misfiring = not the injector) * Scanned for live misfires and saw **Cylinders 1, 5, and 7** misfiring the most * Misfires slowly build at idle (was at about 30 misfire counts on cyl 1 at idle), but **spike fast at high RPM** * Haven’t done a **compression test yet**, that’s next on my list Setup details: * **2015 Charger SRT 392** * Tuned (Underground Tuning Stage 2) * **Advanced burble tune** * **High-flow cats** (possibly damaged from burbles?) * Scanner used: **JScan**, misfire counts verified live I’m getting consistent misfires **only on Bank 1,** except cyl 3? (Driver Side), while Bank 2 cylinders are clean. I’m starting to suspect a clogged high-flow cat on that side or something electrical/fuel related to Bank 1. Could it even be cam or lifter wear? Has anyone dealt with something like this before? Appreciate any help — trying not to keep throwing parts at it. [Here is what the live scan is telling me after flooring it.](https://preview.redd.it/8rf62gmdj82f1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b2e7303f22883163f5d778b2a04d2e16e106b05)",

I’ve had this tune on the car for over 5 months with zero issues until now. The misfires just started recently and only happen under load, not during burbles or lift-off. Cylinders 1, 5, and 7 spike during WOT — not during burble events — so I’m leaning more toward a mechanical, fueling, or exhaust flow issue (possibly the cat). Appreciate the input, though, but this doesn’t seem tune-related based on when and how it’s happening.",

Context to the vid iirc there was an English company that was trying to make a supercar that would be road legal. They produced one and one of the executives took it home for a test drive and on the way home or to the office (I think a rain storm happened) he deemed it too dangerous for the public and they scrapped the idea. If anyone can point me in the direction of this video or send the link that would be extremely helpful. I’ve been trying to search for this video for the last three months.",

I'm in the used tire business and according to new regulation we are not to install any tire that is older than 7 years. Which is just a way to push the sell of more new tires. First of all not all tires are made the same.and some rubber compounds are just better and then not all tires.are made of the same amount of layers . It's not uncommon that iSwap out 20year old 10 ply tires that have served there owners well and then I Find 4 year old 4ply tire's with 70% tread life left that are dry rotted and I have no choice but to recommend replacing. Which I hate to do unless its absolutely necessary..after all I got into the business to save the planet not sell tires. But by keeping as many re usable tires on the road and as much money In ppls pockets as possible allows me to provide a huge service by keeping tire from Filling up the landfills and from making it to the bottom bottom of every river creek, lake, pond and ditch in my town and surrounding area .I encourage ppl to bring them to me and I'll dispose of them free of charge before they dump them on the side of the road . But anyway back on topic the major factor the determines the life of a tire is the environmental conditions it has been exposed to. Fortunately a donut is primarily housed inside of the vehicle somewhere and kept from being exposed to any elements primarily the sun. This significantly extends the life of a spare tire and if you find. 20 year old car that is well maintained it probably has its original spare tire in it and upon visual inspection unless it shows large dry rot crack or separation along the side wall of the tire, it's gonna do it job and get u off the side of the road and to a place you can replace the tire. I have know of ppl that put 1000 mile or drove on a spare for 5 months before buying a replacement tire . Remember keep the tire inflated properly and aviod speeds above 55. Personally I would try to stay under 45 and no high speed cornering or you will roll the tire right of the rim. The most important thing and this will save ur life , is that you never put a donut on a front. Tire. If you have a flat on the front, you jack up the whole side of the car and move the one from the back to the front.and put the donut on the back. Just in case the spare does fail you dont lose stearing and roll off in a ditch, get ejected from ur vehicle and it coming to rest on top of you, Which can really ruin ur day. But besides that you will be fine. Stay safe and remember to check ur tires often .the difference between making it to your destination safely and becoming a statistic is 4 magazine size piece of rubber that are responsible for keeping your 3- 5000lb vehicle and all it's contents connected to the road. I got a tires for every vehicle for any budget and offer payment options if need be and if you still can afford that you probably shouldn't be driving anyway but i ask customers if they want to round up to the next dollar or donate a couple bucks that go into a lil pot that I match every dollar that can be used to help in certain situations but there Is no excuse for riding on bald tire's with wire showing and you just lazy.",

Thirdly the speed thing is because the tyre is made to get you from 1 place to the other to get the original tyre replaced and that’s all so it lacks some features normal tyres have like correct size correction compounds (it’s made to be left without use for years so the rubber is different so it can last while stored but will wear faster when in use) most times they are not balanced and can cause vibrations that can damage parts of the car at high speeds.",

It didn't happen mid-driving, but when I started the car. Sometimes, rear wiper also started moving. Later, same thing started happening when turning lights on and off. A day later, our left rear headlight died, not showing signs of any life except when hitting brake, turning signal or rear fog lights (rear left light, rear left position light and reverse light didn't work). Right side worked perfectly. Took it to mechanic, who fixed it temporarily, because it died 2 days later again. This time however, dashboard lights didn't cycle as we were changing light modes (it is supposed to change the dim of the light when cycling between no lights, position lights, lights on), but our rear left headlight worked as intended. However, now we have another problem with front position lights. They do not turn on whatsoever, while the rears turn on normally. Light is also on, working normally everywhere, but the front positions are not working now. Is there any idea to what may have caused this spike of electronic problems? Car have never been underwater, cleaning is done with water pressure guns ever since 2018 and never had such difficulties with a car. If you know how to fix this or have any suggestion to what may have caused all this, please drop it in the comments.",

There are some that offer improvements, but that involves a bit more work. They make a pod filter that has a corrugated tube on it having that tube insulated against the engine bay heat, and the tube in a place where it can get fresh air like a duct opening in the bumper that work just as good. But they make bolts on specifically made for that purpose. Be warned tho the cruse can get a check engine light from the filter box, not being closed all the way.

You could literally take apart the ECU, pull out a chip, and replace it with a new one with different programming. Chip tuning has largely been irrelevant since OBD2 came out in 1996, allowing for the ECU to be reprogrammed without removing it or taking it apart. With modern cars, you can buy a program for your laptop, connect said laptop to your car's OBD2 connector (using a cheap adapter), and reprogram it using the laptop. A lot of tuners work this way. Some companies will even sell prepackaged tunes for specific cars (EG: SCT). But chipping your car for more power is pretty much always a scam nowadays unless the car in question is from those ancient OBD1 (1988-1995) days. So yes. \"Chipping\" a car is a proper automotive term, but if you're talking about chipping a modern car, any auto enthusiast who knows anything is gonna know you're either old, gullible, or full of shit.

It drives fine up to around 90 km/h, but after that, even with the pedal all the way down, it just feels sluggish — like it has no power left. A friend in a Peugeot 208 with 90 hp actually pulled away from me, which definitely shouldn’t happen… Here’s what I’ve already done: • Changed the air filter • Replaced the fuel pump • Cleaned the MAF sensor • Timing belt • Waterpump I’ve considered whether it might be the Particulate (DPF) but OBDeleven shows the max is 80g and mine is at 54g, so that seems okay? Or could it be clogged intake manifold? Has anyone experienced something similar or have any ideas what could be causing the power loss? Any help or suggestions would be really appreciated",

Since then, I got a new battery, changed the oil and filter, and have periodically tried starting it again with mixed results. Most of the time, nothing happens when I turn the key. Sometimes, the dash will light up then the engine will click as it does with a dead battery. Twice, it has actually turned over. The first time, it ran for a couple seconds. The second, it turned over, fired once, then died. The check engine and battery lights are showing on the dash. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.",

However, without being able to get into the car. It is a 2019 Toyota Aygo that is worth approx. 8000-8700€ I have just had it past a workshop for a quote / assessment, and they think it will take approx. 3-4 days and cost 1700-1900€ to get it fixed, it doesn't seem worth it to me, for a car that is worth a few times that. I wanted to ask what the long-term consequences are of not getting this professionally fixed? I don't really care that much about the damage itself, but I'm more afraid that it may develop rust or something similar in the future. Is it possible to make a homemade DIY solution, e.g. with a paint pen, spray paint or similar? For me, the dent in the back door is okay since you can't see it and it doesn't affect driving. However, I don't want to be faced with an even bigger bill in a couple of years. How it cosmetically looks doesn't bother me Advice is welcome. :)",

The mechanic shared a list of work to be done to the vehicle and I mentioned that I would buy the parts (last mechanic overcharged me). One of the parts was an Acura Cross-Member Set, Front Bulkhead (Lower). After the service, the mechanic said he actually didn’t need to use this part. No issue there, but I tried returning it to carparts.com and was unable to because I lost the packaging it came in and they’re very strict on not accepting returns without original packaging. Does anyone know where the best place would be to sell this and recover some of my money?",

Runs great (for now) other than this new problem of... not starting. I drove about 200 miles to a concert on Wednesday. Went to the concert, came back late at night to the parking garage, car wouldn't turn on. Ignition did nothing - all the dash lights came on as if i was in like 1st position with the key. Computer screens came on, headlights came on, etc. I did not leave my lights on doors open etc while at the concert because I am EXTREMELY paranoid abt dead batteries and I even had my friend with me verify before we left the car. I jumped the car in the garage, all good. Turned back on the next day to drive home. When I got home, had Triple A out to replace the battery. His reader showed me an EXTREMELY low battery. We replaced the battery all fine and good. Car was doing great. Yesterday, after days of having the new battery, the car did the dead thing again. Nothing happened but lights and screens came on. I didn't have time to jump it - I got a ride to work, came back home 8 hours later and tested it - IT STARTED! Turned it off (oops) and ran inside to tell my mom. Came back out to try it again 5 mins later - DEAD. It started from a jump tho thank god. What is happening? Is it a grounding issue? Fusible link? Corroded battery connections? Parasitic battery drain somewhere? I have an appt with the dealership next tuesday but I keep having to randomly jump it when it decides not to turn on. I can't have it in the shop for long because I am going on a trip right after the appt and need the car, so I am hoping it's a quick fix",

I had a similar experience with two vehicles. They would just decide to randomly not start sometimes and then almost randomly trying other times after letting it sit it starts. What is happening is your starter is locking up and unable to turn sometimes and when it happens it draws lots of amps draining your battery fast and not starting the vehicle. also when you say \"Went to the concert, came back late at night to the parking garage, car wouldn't turn on. Ignition did nothing - all the dash lights came on as if i was in like 1st position with the key. Computer screens came on, headlights came on, etc. I\" it sounds like you still have a working battery but your starter is refusing to turn the engine. Sadly because it's a problem that does not always show itself you can't really know for sure till it fails (locks up) and you tow it to a mechanic to test your starter with it locked up. Unless you're mechanically knowledgeable to test this at home. (is ways) What you might want to double check is things that could affect the starter working. Like ground wires, fuses, relays or even loose battery connections. If nothing else is out of place and it happens again I would assume it's your starter based on your descriptions.",

Didn't know it before buying, but apprently the d17 is a very well known for head gasket problems. On my first corolla (1996, 7AFE), I startrd burning extreme amounts of oil through the rings (~3L/tank), and eventually lost compression all together in one of the cylinders.

The head bolts only catch about a 1/4” of the block threads. Over time and heat cycles, the head bolts pull the few threads they are holding onto out of the block and the head gasket starts leaking coolant. This coolant often ends up in the giant insulator between the block and the intake manifold, so it never falls out of the car. You run out of coolant, the engine overheats, you take it to the dealer, and you get blamed for the head gasket failure, so you get to pay for a head gasket job and the associated machining. There is a TSB that is artfully written to address the problem without actually revealing the manufacturer defect. Toyota had Time-Sert build a kit that fixes the pulled threads in the block by installing inserts *10mm higher in the block* so you can use the same head bolts. If they had offered longer head bolts, they would have tipped their hand, so they have a 14 hour TSB instead. These much higher (and harder) inserts will never let go, so a properly done job should be bulletproof (::looks at job that’s been holding for 8 years and a hundred thousand miles:: ::knocks on wood::).

It was apparently even a problem with regular maintenance. Never had the problem my Passat doing that, but I did get to replace the $400 thermostat that had a heater built into the housing. The one that did bite me was the $1200 computer in the trunk located beneath the spare tire. The whole purpose of the module was to pump fuel from one fuel tank to the other for weight distribution, it was stupid.",

Both of these cars have similar HP figures but the torque figures/curve is different because the BMWs have a N55 turbo I6 and the Lexus cars have a 2GR-FSE N/A V6. Which one would be more “fun” to drive? A bit more detail - I regularly drive a 2012 Camry and a 2022 Tiguan. The Camry has a 2.5L N/A inline 4 and the Tiguan has the EA888 2L turbo. Both cars have have about 180HP but the Tiguan has 220 tq that peaks down low at 1500RPM, instead of 165 tq at 4800RPM on the Camry. I love the immediate “shove” that the Tiguan produces, but I absolutely HATE how it runs out of steam after about 4500RPM. Everything between that and redline feels so lifeless and bland. In contrast, I love revving out the N/A engine all the way to redline when I’m driving on backroads but but I feel like passing on the highway is not as effortless because I have to downshift and rev out my engine to make any power. Would my experiences translate directly to 6 cylinder engines or is it different? Would a Turbo I6 have the same “running out of steam up top” problem? Would a N/A V6 feel like it needs to put out much more effort to pass on the highway?",

Me and my dad have replaced the spark plugs the spark plug wires, distributor cap, the oil, fuel pump, throttle sensor or something but still no luck trying to start it. The engine sounds fine but then right when it sounds like it's gonna start it just shuts off. When we spray starting fluid into some part (not the biggest car guy but my dad knows) it starts fine and then the starting fluid runs out it sounds like it literally explodes and the car shuts off again. We are thinking it's fuel problems because even after changing the fuel pump to a brand new one we still only hear it when we crank the key rather than just turning the car on. I have videos of trying to start it and shi someone help tho 🙏",

I got my car back on a Friday, and by Monday morning i started experiencing issues when accelerating from a stop. The car would start accelerating and then almost start “jumping” until it finally accelerated normally, this only happens from stop to go like from a stop sign or traffic light and not when accelerating any other time. This was not happening before engine replacement. Really just trying to find any kind of answers, i took my car back to dealership and of course symptoms wont occur for them so they dismissed me and said car was running fine and sounded good. Dealership also said transmission issue is unlikely. It is consuming oil at a faster rate than before replacement. 🙄",

I kept my car in my garage and kept the windows down so it could air out overnight. This morning, the car has a musty smell…so I’m worried that there’s mold growing in my car. Interiors are black so I can’t tell visually. At this point, I don’t know what to do. Should I take it a professional detailer or can I do something at home? EDIT: Thank you all SO MUCH for all the advice! I kept the windows down, pulled down the back seats and opened the trunk to let it air out in the sun. I pulled out the mats that I could remove to air dry. I got a box of DampRid to keep in the car.

As non mechanics with simple tools, we took the front passenger seat out and the rear passenger seat out in maybe 30 minbutes. Saved us \\~$800.

You want 50% hot because you want to have the AC compressor constantly running, and warm air coming out the vents which will help the water evaporate off the carpet into the air which will then get sucked back into the evaporator and turned into moisture under the coils and rejected through the condensate drain under the car. You should start seeing tons of water coming out. When you park at night leave the windows cracked. 5 gallons is not a whole lot of water, I've seen worse. keep at it, eventually you'll have it dry. The second option is to rent a dehumidifier from home Depot and put it in there and run the hose out the window, if it'll fit... I don't know if they have one that'll fit those things are pretty big. The final option is to remove the seats and the trim on the floor and pull the carpet kit out and set in the sun for 8 hours. The advantage of this option is you can thoroughly clean your carpet while it's out of the car. source: back in 2008 My mom was bringing some flowers home from the florist for my sister's wedding, I wasn't there when they loaded them because if I was I would have told them to load all of the buckets in the front of the van... but instead they loaded them by the tailgate, well, they got in the freeway and somebody cut them off and guess what happened?? about 20 gallons of water inside her van. was gone in about a week. keep the windows open or you'll have a hell of a time defogging the windows in the morning.",

And now I’m getting “people always wanna steal your Civic” comments. Never change, Reddit, never change.",

I took it to a local mechanic who diagnosed and fixed the problem. See first attachment for repair description. After picking the car up, I noted that when I put the emergency brake on and had the car in neutral and turned around to buckle my kids in the car started drifting back because the emergency break was not fully engaged. It took both of my arms yanking up at great force to get the emergency break to fully engage. I had called the repair shop about this to get it fixed and had planned to take it in the following week but then a couple days later I was driving and heard a loud pop and thought I blew a tire got out and saw no tire issues. Then when I tried to drive forward, the car wouldn’t let me drive forward after trying pushing harder on the gas eventually went and then started making a loud clanging noise in the back of the car. The repair shop came and picked the car up and drove it back to their shop and did more repairs which were all done for free. See second repair order picture for reference. I am curious if it is likely that they messed up something on the first repair and caused a problem which led to this second repair. I am not very knowledgeable in cars so I was wondering if anyone couldn’t enlighten me on if whatever they did the first time would have impacted the issue that arose or if they didn’t inspect the car well enough and missed this other issue. I feel like they wouldn’t have done the second repair for free if they had no culpability but don’t know anything about cars to back up that gut feeling. Thanks so much!!",

I got my car serviced by the dealer the other day, knowing I needed an oil change and my filters (cabin and engine air) changed. I went in with intent to buy the air filters and install it myself. It was fairly busy so I thought I’d be in there for an hour+ which is typically how long I assume would take. Well, fast forward 20 minutes later, the service person said my car is done. It’s wet, from their “complimentary” car service and the 200+ multipoint check says my engine air and cabin air filters are green and in great shape! I checked the oil and it looked clean on my dip stick. So I’ll give them benefit of the doubt they did in fact do my oil change. To the mechanics: I am fairly turned off by this dealer and will never go back because they clearly don’t do the services they say (even the bogus multi point check up). I want to find an honest mechanic and not have to worry about if these mechanics actually do the work I paid for. I am at a point I’d just go find a weekend job to learn at oil lube shops to make money and learn them myself. Please. Any advice?",

        "body": "TL;DR: if your oil is clean and the car doesn’t have any obvious issues, then they did what you paid them to. Just because it was fast doesn’t mean it was done poorly. Servicing a car doesn’t really take that long on a lift, and that 200+ point “inspection” is really just more so glancing at everything making sure nothing is detrimentally wrong (ie all your brakes are present, tires aren’t bald/flat, transmission isn’t actively dumping fluid, etc.). Most of the time when services take over an hour it’s because either the service advisor forgot to give someone the job or everyone is busy in that moment. Being done quick doesn’t always mean they’re a dishonest shop, most of the time it just means they’re either slow on work or the technicians are quick with the job. When you service the same 3 cars 14 times a day for a year straight you get pretty quick with the service. Also, the mechanic is rarely the dishonest one in bad shops, typically it’s bad service writers or bad management who try to coerce you into work that isn’t exactly necessary to make a quick buck.",

I just have a couple questions for folks more familiar with the process than I am -Should I replace the spark plug when swap out the coil? -From what i understand, that code is for the #4 coil, so the front row far right? Is that correct? If anyone is willing to give me a step by step on this one I'd appreciate it. I'm pretty handy and have good tools, I just haven't tackled this particular project before. Thanks!",

First, I simply wrapped the holes in rubber tape, and it worked perfectly, car started running normally and no longer stalled at idle. Then I went over a speed bump and it started running poorly and stalling again, so I tried again, but with rubber cement and more rubber tape this time. I tried starting it after that and it won't start. So then I replaced the air intake hose, and it still doesn't start. Video of what it sounds like. I have tried spraying starter fluid into the throttle body just before trying to start it, and I have tried doing that with the MAF unplugged. Neither worked.

Earlier today, I accelerated hard from a stop out of a shopping center driveway into fast-moving traffic. I heard what sounded like one of the wheels momentarily spinning out—maybe some traction loss. Immediately afterward, a whole series of warning lights and messages appeared on the dash: – Electronic Stabilization Control (ESC) – Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) – Airbag system – Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) not available – Front Assist not available – ABS / Stabilization Control I’d been driving for several hours before that without any issues, so it was a sudden and strange event. No check engine light—just what looks like every other system deciding to bail out at once. Anyone had this happen before? Could a brief traction event have triggered a chain reaction with sensors, or does this sound more like a voltage/battery issue or something deeper like a wheel speed sensor failure? Planning to scan for codes soon, but I’d appreciate any insight or similar experiences.",

That is not a vehicle with any engine that runs hot without something wrong. Bad fan clutch, lots of bug or stuff in radiator air passages, coolant passages in radiator plugged, water pump with rusted away impeller blades are things that cause overheat on a hill climb. The order of my list is close to order of likelihood. That vehicle does not have a reverse flow cooling system like many do these days, so bleeding and air pockets are very unlikely for an Econoline v6, v8, or v10.",

I have a 2024 Kia Seltos 1.6 Turbo, and the car is still very new with less than 10,000 km on it. Recently, I started noticing a slight vibration or shuddering when the speed reaches between 30 to 40 km/h. No warning lights on the dashboard I scanned the car and no error codes appeared Unfortunately, there is no official Kia dealership or service center in my country I’m wondering if anyone has experienced something similar? Could it be related to bad fuel quality? Or possibly something with the transmission or gearbox? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!",

Not to mention that the car is worthless (it has maybe 1.5k in value on the high end) If the block test failed, it would probably be a headgasket.

According to the manual, that light concerns ESP, ASR or ABS. I still had an old, cheap BT ODBII dongle (10+yo) lying around and downloaded \"Car Scanner\" app. Apparently, it read 198 values and (pretty early on) found P0172 (System too rich, bank 1) and P0101 (Mass air flow (MAF) sensor/volume air flow (VAF) sensor - range/performance problem). This morning, my wife switched ESP off and on and the light is off now. * Would the MAF issue also trigger that light? * The handbrake is a little dodgy and sometimes gets stuck. Could this cause an ESP error? * Wouldn't we expect this to show up in the error codes? * How serious is the MAF issue?

Now my car was still driving, has no power drop nothing the car can still drive perfectly everything was working apart from the beeping and the lights on the dash. If I turn the car off and back on again everything returns to usual but this whole process starts again maybe 10-20 minutes later. Does anyone know what could be up also iv tried disconnecting the positive wire to the battery for 10+ seconds and putting it back on and my problem starts again maybe",

OP has a diesel, components are more than robust enough to handle high electrical load. Yes the alternator is rated to charge a dead battery. In what world wouldn't it be? Braindead takes here. If anything your alternator failed under load because it was already failing. That's what kills cars after doing a jump. Your alternator has already shit the bed, you just don't know it's barely working because all it has to do is maintain a battery. You get one really cold night and that thing was gonna die anyways. That's not a problem with jumping cars. It's a problem with your alternator bud. If I used a truck to tow something well under capacity and 3rd gear spat itself out on the highway would I say the problem is that you were towing as intended by the manufacturer or that your transmission was already half dead? OP, the specific vehicle this is will help us figure out why its doing what it's doing. If it's an 89' Ford f250 it might have two batteries and mechanical injection, which changes the reasons why it might be doing this. If it's a 2024 opel diesel or something the reasons are gonna be different.",

First, I changed all four spark plugs, and it ran great for about a month. Then the shaking started coming back — mostly at highway speeds (above 80 km/h). It feels like a light misfire at first, then becomes more noticeable. I replaced all four ignition coils (they were cracked), and it improved again for a bit. But now the issue comes and goes — sometimes the car runs awesome, other times it shakes and has low performance, especially above 80 km/h. Here’s what I’ve done so far: Changed spark plugs and ignition coils Replaced coolant and radiator cap Replaced fuel cap Checked connectors for coils, O2 sensor, and MAP sensor Checked air filter and cabin filter Engine oil is clean and at good level I’m really stuck at this point. Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated!",

I checked my transmission fluid and there’s fluid in there and then my check engine light came on when my transmission was slipping on the highway earlier then I went to get the check engine light read and it said to change the whole transmission valve system and circuits and what not which I’m not a car girl so I don’t know much about but I was told expensive and I talked to two people and they said that my best bet is just to lease a car or finance one because my transmission is about to blow and getting it fixed is gonna cost more than the worth of my car so what do you guys think I should do and I absolutely have no money right now, so I’m kind of stuck.",

I'm still having issues after the second battery and the shop said they couldn't figure out the issue as the battery tested good and the alternator tested good. But they didn't test it while driving, only idling. So I bought an OBDII scanner and immediately while driving the voltage was reading 12.7-13v, then when I started driving it was dropping down to 11.5ish, then at the lowest 11.2v. immediately to me this read bad alternator. and correct me if im wrong but doing research it seems like the battery was on the verge of dying. Doesn't 13v or less mean the alternator is barely charging if even at all, and around 10.5-11v is where the car starts to lose power? I ordered a remanufactured denso alternator for $135 and planning to replace it myself as the shop quoted me $750 (absolutely insane) for just an alternator replacement. Just trying to make sure I did a proper diagnosis as I am by no means a car expert. Any insight would help, thank you.",

    "selftext": "The other day (a couple months ago) I was driving my 1995 Dodge Dakota I had recently purchased. Unfortunately, the temperature gauge was broken. I was driving it and noticed that it wasn’t getting over 30-35 with my pedal to the floor. As I pulled into a parking lot, it just shut off. It started up thirty seconds later and drove a little, and died, and started a couple more times, but would die the second I put it into gear and lightly applied the gas. Additionally, we couldn’t push it into a spot. The brakes were locked up. We could push it just fine two hours later, but not when it first shut off. It started, but only on starting fluid, so I figured it was vapor lock. However, two days later, it wouldn’t start on starting fluid, and I noticed that it was completely out of coolant & missing the radiator fan relay. Additionally, every time I cranked it, it would leak a little bit of oil on the ground. Otherwise, completely dry. Only when cranking. Fast forward two months, I’ve decided it’s time to fix or sell. Does anyone know what the problem is? My first guess is head gasket, but I don’t want to dig into doing a head gasket only for the head to be cracked, or for it not to fix the problem. Also, I’d love for it to be a quicker fix. The other weird thing is that it never smoked and the oil looks normal, not like mayo or peanut butter Finally, yes I’m an idiot for not checking the coolant repeatedly to see if it was leaking, and not noticing that the relay was missing, and for a million other things I’m sure. Does anyone have any advice for me?",

    "selftext": "Hi all, about two months ago (March 22, 2025), I was driving on a gravel/rocky road at relatively low speeds (\\~8-15mph). As I was driving on this road, I heard what appeared to be some small rocks getting flung up against the car's bottom. This would lead to the splash shield (Honda part number [74110-TR3-A10](https://www.hondafactoryparts.com/oem-parts/honda-under-cover-74110tr3a10)), which was already somewhat damaged, to become even more damaged, to the point that a part of it was now scraping the ground when driving in certain conditions. I ended up cutting the part of the damaged shield that was scaping against the ground. Additionally, there's now this rattling sound that can be heard when driving. I [linked a recording](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6k9tR0m7wAg) of the rattling from my most recent drive; the rattling starts around 10 seconds in. This rattling sound is barely audible when driving on flat (\"good\") roads, and it's basically a non-issue when driving at fast speeds. However, the rattling sound becomes more audible when driving on more rough (\"bad\") roads, such as roads with bumps. The recording here is me driving on a road where there's a fair amount of very small potholes and small rocks here and there. Another interesting thing to note is that, when I cold start the car while the air conditioner was on, \\*occasionally\\* there is a loud, very noticeable rattling sound, that occurs for about 15 seconds. This just sounds like a much louder, more continuous version of this audio clip here. This only happens on a cold start and when the A/C is on. If the car is in operating temperatures and the A/C is on, that rattling sound isn't audible. As of recently, this seems to be happening less and less. The A/C still works just fine. ***I should emphasize that, prior to March 22, I never heard any rattling sounds like in this audio clip.*** My first suspicion is that the old splash shield became loose/damaged thus causing the rattling noise. So, about a month after the incident, I purchased an aftermarket splash shield and replaced the damaged splash shield with the new splash shield. This did not fix the rattling noise. I took the car to the dealership for an inspection, where they told me the car was actually involved a prior collision that I wasn't aware of. They refused to do any further inspection, telling me that the car should go to an auto body shop to get fixed up, and that there could be many different reasons for the rattling sound. For what it's worth, the previous owner -- my dad -- was actually involved in a very minor collision, and he got the car fixed up at the local auto body shop. Nonetheless, the rattling sound is only a recent issue, so I don't think the prior collision would have caused this. Anyways, today, I spent a few hours trying to figure out why the rattling sound is happening. * I took the splash shield off, thinking maybe I installed it incorrectly, and took the car for a drive with no shield. The rattling sounds did not go away. * While the splash shield was off, I spent a little bit of time trying to see if there were any loose/unstable parts. The only part I found that was pretty loose was the front engine splash shield (I believe the Honda part number is [74111-TR3-A00](https://www.hondafactoryparts.com/oem-parts/honda-2012-2015-honda-civic-shield-front-splash-74111tr3a00)). I didn't check this too carefully, just merely looked around at anything the rocks might have hit. * I also looked around to see if there were any rocks or other debris that might be causing the rattling sounds. I did find what appeared to be a broken push pin stuck between that shield and the car, although this didn't get rid of the rattling. * I also inspected the engine bay to see if there were any loose parts. I don't think there were any. Anyways, I'm unsure where else to look for. Given that there could probably be a billion different reasons for the rattling, I suspect I might need to take this car in for another inspection at an independent mechanic, so that'll be my next plan. That being said, I guess my questions are: * Given that the car drives fine (no other unknown issues and, aside from the rattling, **driving the car feels and sounds the same before and after the incident**), is this something to be concerned about? Right now, this is more of an annoyance than anything else, but I don't know if this is something to be more concerned about. * Do you guys have any other ideas of where I should check? Thanks in advance for any advice given!",

She wants me to buy it from her which I am likely to do (she wants $5K), but before I do, I need a professional to take a look and tell me everything that needs to be done to get it ready. (I guess I should say that if I buy it, this will not be a daily driver - just around town when a 3rd car is needed) Putting some thought into it, I came up with a list of things that I think need to be done. Do you have any thoughts or opinions? Is it worth reviving or should we just sell it? Here's my breakdown: |Service|Estimated Cost Range| |:-|:-| || |Battery Replacement|$150 – $300| |Fluid Replacements|$500 – $900| |New Tires|$800 – $1,200| |Brake System Overhaul|$500 – $1,500| |Fuel System Cleaning|$300 – $800| |Belts and Hoses Replacement|$200 – $500| |Comprehensive Inspection|$150 – $300| |**Total Estimated Cost**|**$2,600 – $5,500**|",

Former is because I'm pretty sure these had the (very expensive to maintain) ABC system as standard. IIRC this is also from the era when the biodegradable wiring insulation MB used was extra-tasty to rodents. They were/are nice cars, and if you can get it fully road-worthy for \\~10k or less all in, it might not be a bad deal, but it's still a 20 year old $100k-MSRP Benz, so future maintenance will always be pricey and surprises will happen.",

She was old and slow, and as my mom always says, I should’ve broken down a long time ago. But I truly believe she had a spirit or some sort of guardian angel looking out for me. She never got into an accident, never broke down—she just kept running, just for me. Unfortunately, her engine was a mess, and fixing it would’ve been too much. I needed a safer, more reliable vehicle, so I had to say goodbye. I'm heartbroken and have been crying all day. But the person I sold her to owns an auto shop and plans to fix her up for his daughter, so I guess she’ll live on in a way. It’s hard to let go of the car that protected me for five years, the one that saw me through high school and college. She wasn’t just a car to me; she was a companion.

Mechanic said it was the motor and quoted me $360 for the part + $80 labor, so I decided to DIY it. I bought a $65 replacement motor off eBay and installed it myself. The issue still persists. Here’s what I’ve done: * Replaced the window motor * Tested the switch – getting 12V in both directions * Ran the motor unmounted from the window – it goes down fine, but going up it clicks and then stops * Glass moves freely, no binding * I replaced the car battery recently, so power supply shouldn't be the issue It seems like the motor is getting power but cuts out or hits some sort of resistance going up. Is this a regulator issue? Wiring? Switch even though it tests fine? Would really appreciate any insight. Thanks!",

    "selftext": "hi all, i have very little car knowledge and really could use some help. i bought a cheap Nissan Sentra 09 that was pretty beat up to use for work. I would say my usage of it has been very light compared to what it had gone through, and i've done regular maintenance on it. Before being sold to me it had been at over 125k, had been in collisions, and a lot of structural damage. I put about 40k on it in the last 5 years and a good amount of money to repair it including replacing the whole axel. However it is due for numerous general repairs, as well as some other more costly repairs totaling up to 3k based on a recent estimate. The doors are having electrical and mechanical issues and it's really annoying to open. tpms sensors need to be replaced. The tires are starting to bald. The muffler is almost completely rusted out. the blower motor needs to be replaced. The strut assembly needs to be replaced. Engine and transmission mount needs to be replaced. Brakes are okay but worn out. I'm also up for reupping my insurance and other bills, and am facing a layoff at work, so this is not ideal. Right now the engine seems okay and it starts up fine, tho sometimes it has a weird laggy stalling feeling when i brake and press on gas. i'm anxious that it will cost more to fix it up than it is worth especially if it is on it's last legs. is this car at the end of its life? It would be hard to not have a car right now but i also don't want to flush money down the toilet if it seems like she might give out. Appreciate any advice you guys have.",

I don't like the rims and wanna replace them with something black but that size just doesn't seem super popular/have a lot of options. Is there an issue swapping to 20x10.5 or 20x11 for all of them? Also when looking at some rims the 20x11 say Rear only. Does that mean I can't throw them on the front wheels since they're the same size as what I have now? What makes them \"Rear only\"",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I recently changed the transmission fluid on my 2010 Toyota Camry myself, and I've run into an issue. I'm now noticing a noise and a slight shake when shifting into Reverse (R) and Drive (D), particularly when the car is first started and during parking maneuvers. The noise and vibration seem a bit more pronounced when shifting into R. These symptoms are not very loud or violent, so they can be hard to detect once I'm driving normally. However, they definitely exist, at least for the first few minutes of driving. Interestingly, sometimes after driving for a bit (e.g., a 3miles trip to Walmart), the noise and shaking will disappear when shifting into D. Both the noise and shake in R and D seem to go away completely after a longer drive （around 10miles on the highway）. Before the fluid change, I did occasionally experience a similar, but much milder, noise and shake in R. This would usually disappear as soon as the car started moving or after about 10seconds. Now, the symptoms are more persistent and harder for them to disappear. **Regarding driving performance:** There isn't a huge difference when driving, though **the shifts** ***might*** **feel slightly less smooth.** However, this is very subtle and not easily noticeable. There's no noticeable loss of power. I also haven't experienced a situation where the RPMs increase during acceleration, but the car's speed doesn't change, which might indicate slipping. Unfortunately, my OBD2 scanner can't read current gear information, so I don't know exactly when it's shifting. **Key details:** * **Car:** 2010 Toyota Camry * **Work Done:** DIY transmission fluid change. * **Symptoms:** Noise and shaking when shifting into R and D; possibly slightly less smooth shifts. * **When it Happens:** Noise/shaking most noticeable when the car is cold or has been sitting. Worse in R. * **When it Improves/Disappears:** Noise/shaking sometimes improves for D after a short drive. Both R and D symptoms seem to resolve after a longer drive (fully warmed up). * **Comparison to Before:** Similar noise/shake issue existed mildly in R before, but is now more pronounced and persistent after the fluid change. **My questions:** 1. Has anyone experienced similar issues after a transmission fluid change on this generation of Camry (or similar Toyotas)? 2. What could be the potential causes? I'm wondering about: * Incorrect fluid level (too high or too low)? I know these can be tricky without a dipstick. * Wrong type of transmission fluid? (I can provide details on what I used if helpful). * Air trapped in the system? * Did the fluid change perhaps highlight an existing issue? 3. What steps would you recommend for troubleshooting this? For example, how critical is the exact fluid level checking procedure (temperature, etc.)? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance. I consulted a mechanic, who was recommended by a friend, about this issue. However, he seemed unhappy that I changed the transmission fluid. He believes that you should never change the transmission fluid on an old car and that doing so will inevitably cause the transmission to fail. I also have a video recording where you can hear the noise. In the recording, I shift from Park (P) to Reverse (R) at approximately the 5-second mark. If you look at the opened car door in the video, you might be able to notice the shake as well.",

I have had Lucy for about 3 years now and she has done me incredibly well for my first car. My parents are wanting me to trade her In for something a bit newer (not now but in the future) and I'm really not sure what to do, because I'm not a massive car person but I do like to tinker from time to time and I have a few plans for her if I do decide to keep her. I would like to get the paint redone and maybe some coilovers and some new rims and a whole bunch of other stuff... like a muffler delete 🤤 but I'm not sure with the age of lucy would it be worth doing it. I would hate for her to cross over the 300,000 kilometers mark (currently about 245,000) and then the engine crap out or something that sorta forces my hand. If I do replace lucy it would deffently be a mazda again but I have this feeling that if I was to replace her it would be a big mistake because I see alot of Mazda 3's on the road but not the SP23 variant. And I feel when I done with her she would be really unique which is sorta my dream car im not really a big fancy sports car kinda guy. But on the other hand she is starting to get to the age were massive work needs to be done on her, like she needs some new control arms cause the bushings are starting to go in the rear, a couple belts need to be replaced cause there starting to squeal like a stuck pig. I see the points my parents are making but at the same time...... that's my baby 🥺 Idk, feel free to comment what you think any advice welcome just need some outside opinions.",

This is why people who don't use hand brakes and instead rely on leaving a car in park are complete morons. When you put the car in park, in most gearboxes a spring loaded plunger pushes on the park pawl, when the park gear is in a suitable location, the plunger can travel it's full distance and push the pawl into one of the gaps on the gear. The plunger now takes any outward force and transfers this to the gearbox case. The sideways force is taken by the pawl and its pivot point. Hence you can literally blow a hole in the case. You can also break the pawl, or a piece of it, and this will then cause mechanical mayhem at some undetermined time later. Usually people are lucky and the pawl will not engage with a moving gear and instead skips along the teeth leading to a horrible noise. Occasionally tho, the outcome isn't that great. If there are options for internal access (depending on what car/ gearbox, i would recommend pulling output speed sensor, or something in the vicinity of the park gear and utilising a borescope camera for an internal investigation. Mainly because you heard a strange noise afterwards... Edit: just saw your video. If that is not road/suspension noise, and wasn't their prior, I would recommend not driving it any further, putting it on a tilt tray and taking it to a mechanic.",

The ABS, TC and brake lights were still on and the others lights came on after a test drive. I tried to reset the system but it wouldn't let me and just kept showing U0141 \"Lost communication with the body control module 'A'\". Does anyone know what else I can do to try and fix this problem. The car runs fine and nothing else thank God stopped working like some have said online. I'm losing my mind trying to figure this out.

If your better half wants it \"like better,\" you could try touch up paint from an auto part store. Then throw a coat of polish on it (what, it's like $10 and whatever you price a few hours on a lazy Sunday). I like NuCoat in the orange bottle. Invite her out to see how good it looks, and then segue into comments about how good she looks. No downshot possible, thank me later Oh, and prices, polish is about $10, touchup paint is probably $10-20 and the part shop guys can help you get the right color code, car soap is probably another $10 or just go to a car wash and get the cheapest one with soap.",

    "selftext": "So. Battery has been dying, had to jump it if I didn't drive it for about a days time. Took it to Walmart they said it's a bad battery so I got it replaced. Seemed fine for a few days drove it every day, one day it was slow turning over then it sped up and started in a matter of a few seconds. Then today when it was dead dead. Couldn't unlock my doors with the fob. When I put my key in the ignition, the windshield wipers came on when nothing else did and the stick was in the off position. Key was locked into the ignition as well. Jumped it and it drove me to work. Went to start it on my lunch break (4 hours of being off) and again it's dead dead. Also while I drove it, the radio turned completely off randomly. Didn't hit a bump or anything. Screen went totally black. Gonna get it checked tomorrow but, wondering if there's any suggestions what it might be? My guess is wiring but, it's been rolling around in my head all day. 2015 chevy malibu if it matters.",

I also recently discovered this car doesn’t have power steering fluid because it has an electric motor for it. So, is the purge valve another thing the hybrid doesn’t have or what other thing could it be? Because I smell gas in the car and also get “system too lean bank 1” codes.

If you've been driving it a lot with no problems you can assume it'll be fine for the long drive, but that will only do you so much good",

I couldn't figure out why until today when I found out about this when I went to touch my strut mounts. Driver side Feels Loose and My Passenger side doesn't and both are brand new. Could this be the culprit as to why all this is the case? And if so do I need to just tighten the screws?",

If voltage stays up around 14v alternator on the muatang is probably fine. Oh and re the connector, it may well be important. May also be useless. For convenience they often have a single wiring loom with all the connectors which they fir to every chassis. Then adding options is just a matter of plugging things in.

I logged my vehicle speed and engine RPM. My thinking was, if I calculate `speed / RPM`, I should be able to see which gear the car is in, right? Like, I'd expect to see 6 distinct, relatively straight lines on a plot, each representing a different gear ratio. But when I plotted it out, it's... well, a bit of a Jackson Pollock. There's no super clear pattern of 6 distinct levels. I get that there are 6 gears, so there should theoretically be 6 main \"rates,\" but my data isn't showing that cleanly. What gives? Is my understanding of how an AT works flawed, or is something else going on?",

    "selftext": "I dropped off my car to the dealership in to fix my display screen that went completely black. I couldn’t use my back camera, radio, etc. The guys at the dealership replaced the radio, but it didn’t fix the problem. They let me pick the car back up, while waiting for a “fuse” or new radio head. When I picked up the car, I noticed the mileage on my car dropped significantly than what I brought it in with. My mileage was originally around 22k, and now dropped down to 15k. I let them know this when I brought the car back in for repair a few days later. They said it shouldn’t be a problem. Now, they’ve finally replaced the radio, and my miles are still down at 15k. They are trying to tell me that that is the correct mileage because that’s what the computer is reading. I told them I’m not accepting the car back because of the discrepancy in the mileage. Mind you, this is a 2024 that I bought brand new in February 2024. Any advice on how I should handle this? The dealership wants me to accept the vehicle at what it is and is insisting my mileage is accurate at 15k. I also have a random photo from October 2024 of my dashboard reflecting 17k miles, and my last oil change in December- the car was at 22k… so not sure how they can try to justify the 15k mileage being correct just because that’s what the computer is reading.",

You may need to cut up an old plastic card to make a removal tool for the radio cage “The metal bit with the tabs sticking out”. You would slide it in between the radio and the cage on sides near the middle or once the radio is out, you can probably just pull back the lock tabs on the sides. You will likely need to remove the entire adaptor kit, unplug the radio harness and antenna, and install the adaptor kit and radio as a unit, plugging it in before it goes in the dash. The other option is sending the antenna wire and harness through the cage, install the adaptor kit, plug in the radio, and shove it in until it clicks into place, being careful not to warp the radio or crack the case.",

    "selftext": "Hey there! Got myself a BMW e60 520D, I will post some pictures. Got this in May last year and yeah, had it for a year now. So far I have tinted my back windows, tuned it to stage 1 for a few more horses and better gas milage, minor interior changes like wooden shifter to match the wooden trim, new plates and badges for a fresh look and most recently got new rims, spacers coming soon. The question, should I do anything more? I like to style it, it's fun, but also expensive and I don't want to overdo it in any way at all. The thought of a m-sport bumper or downpipe has struck me, but it's pricey and turns it into a generic \"bmw build\". The plan is to do a swirl-flap delete this summer to prevent any unwanted accidents, check some vacuum tubes for leaks as I experience some minor problems with acceleration on the 3rd gear and get new brakes as these ones are a bit dated. I'll add some pictures, grateful for any advice or opinion",

The thing is, I could save money for a better car, I could probably sell this and buy a faster and newer one, but this car just runs like a dream and looks good. The interior is flawless with beige leather and wooden trim, also good fuel economy, so this car is just awesome. Although I am looking at 530/535d's from time to time. I agree that msport wheels would look better but yeah, expensive. These wheels actually look better in person, as they somehow look a lot darker on picture. I actually like the style of the rims, but yeah thanks for the comment, love the feedback.",

Taken it to Firestone twice and hadn’t fixed the issue. They’ve replaced both front calipers, rotors, and pads so everything has less than ~200 miles on it since replacing a month ago. The only time the squeak/chirping is present is if the car is going <30mph, and is present even if I’m not actively engaging the brake. Wondering if it could be the hub module, as I’ve largely ruled out suspension issues due to its persistence on flat ground the same as bumpy roads. Also have ruled out a belt issue because this car got a new belt ~10k miles ago.",

    "selftext": "Tldr at the end, sorry for the long post Last year my Aunt gifted me her old car to help me out of a tough spot, and I'm incredibly grateful for it. It's older than I am, but it has been very well maintained, and had less than 100k miles on it when I got it. That being said, this is an old car and it is not without many quirks and challenges. I've learned a lot about cars and fixing them since I got it, with the help of my dad (he was a big car guy before he had kids) Right from the get go I noticed an alarming problem where my car would start to creep forward when I was at a stop, and the resistance on my brake pedal would slowly decrease. The creeping would decrease if I put on the emergency brake and pumped the pedal, and the resistance would return for a few minutes. Talked to my dad, and he said this is obviously an issue with the hydrolics, and he taught me how to bleed the breaks. It helped but didn't fix the problem entirely. I googled the problem and found a forum post from eons past that went over my head saying it had something to do with the drum brake and the emergency brake. My dad kind of scoffed at me about it (for some reason he thinks finding answers on the internet is only valid when he does it, haha) but he had his mechanic come look at it. His mechanic rebuilt (???) the drum brake? I have no idea how that works, but the mechanic said the previous guy who worked on it put something together wrong. He also said the hydrolic lines looked fine and we had bled the breaks correctly. These things also helped a lot, but the problem persisted, specifically when the weather is warm. At this point I think my dad has gotten a little defensive (and has a bit of stung pride), because he's tried his best to help me fix it yet the problem hasn't gone away. He has been telling me that there is no earthly reason the car would keep doing this specifically when the weather warms up. I know correlation does not equal causation, but I've driven this car like 30-40 miles a day for the past year and this is the only correlation I can make. I will definitely admit I have very little experience with cars though, so I am open to being wrong about this. Mostly I feel like I'm going a little crazy. Help me Car Talk - you're my only hope. TLDR- The issue: -Car creeps forward while pressing the brake pedal. -Brake pedal loses resistance until I am pushing it to the floor. -Pumping the brakes helps ease the issue for long enough to stay stopped safely at an intersection. - I've noticed (perhaps incorrectly) that this gets worse when the weather is warm. The fixes we've tried that have somewhat helped: -bled the brake line -Mechanic rebuilt (I have no idea what that means) the drum brake. The questions: -is there something I am not noticing because I don't have car experience that I should be paying attention to? -Does anyone have any idea why the fixes we've done have helped, but not fixed the issue? -Wtf is wrong with the brakes?",

The service booklet has been filled in and stamped with every service. It received everything exactly on time, from oil changes to filters to v belts. You name it, they did it. HOWEVER, there is no sticker whatsoever stating when the timing belt was last replaced nor any mention of it in the booklet. I'm nervous to drive with it because i know from experience the timing belt doesnt give you a warning; if it breaks, it breaks and it will take the engine down with it. And looking at the current kms on it, its due soon or had to already have been done. (According to the manual it should be done every 10y or every 120-150k km) Money isn't the issue, but any mechanic i call can't fit me in until later next week. Can i keep driving with it until i can replace the belt or what do i do? I dont have any other means of transportation",

Action taken: * Parked checked the oil level - level a bit high but OK. * Started the car - light still on * Revved the engine lightly - light turned off then turned back on on idle * Revved the engine strongly - light turned off and stayed off (for the whole duration of drive to garage and at garage for multiple startups) * Checked with OBD code reader - no errors shown * Got the oil & filter changed - light still off * 30 min test drive - small flicker whilst going into gear 1 from idle * Tested idle and startups - half of the idle-to-1st gear the light would come up for <1s; half of the startups the light would be on until car is revved. The light never stays on for more than a second (except on startup when it stays until first revved). It doesn’t seem to come any longer while driving. I’m wondering if this is something I can monitor or if I should avoid longer drives (say 300 miles) until it’s diagnosed. Any advice appreciated!",

    "selftext": "Hello. A friend has a 2010 Chevy Traverse and while going to work it died. Towed home, connected the code reader and the following 5 codes popped up. I only know a few things, but given the timing chain was mentioned I thought it would be better to ask around before firing off the Parts Cannon. Any information on what this might be would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Code 2635: The P2635 code in a Chevy Traverse indicates a problem with the fuel pump \"A\" flow performance, meaning the fuel pump isn't delivering the correct fuel pressure. This code typically means the check engine light is on and you may experience engine-related issues like poor performance, trouble starting, or misfires. Common causes include a failing fuel pump, a faulty fuel pump control module, or wiring problems. Code 0336: The P0336 DTC in a Traverse indicates a crankshaft position sensor circuit problem, specifically a \"Range/Performance\" issue. This means the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is receiving a signal from the crankshaft position sensor that's outside of its expected parameters. Possible causes include a faulty sensor, a damaged reluctor ring, or wiring issues. Code P0420: A P0420 code on a Chevy Traverse indicates a catalyst system efficiency below threshold, meaning the catalytic converter is not working efficiently enough to reduce emissions. This could be caused by a variety of issues, including a failing catalytic converter, exhaust leaks, faulty oxygen sensors, or even engine problems. Code P0087: A P0087 code on a Chevy Traverse indicates that the fuel rail pressure is too low. This means the engine isn't receiving enough fuel to run properly, potentially causing issues like stalling, poor performance, or increased fuel consumption. The code is triggered when the vehicle's engine computer (PCM) detects a drop in fuel rail pressure. Code P0430: The P0430 code on a Chevy Traverse indicates that the catalytic converter on Bank 2 is not functioning efficiently, meaning it's not cleaning the exhaust gases properly. This code can be triggered by various factors, including a faulty catalytic converter, exhaust leaks, or issues with the oxygen sensors. Code P0008: Code P0008 in a Chevy Traverse indicates an issue with the engine's position system, specifically misalignment of the crankshaft and camshaft on bank 1. This often points to a problem with the timing chain or tensioner, causing improper timing and engine performance issues. (I went and looked at the vehicle. It cranks fine, all the belts are intact, gas isn't bad, thinking it might be the fuel pumps or a clogged up catalytic converter. Thoughts!? Thanks.)",

Wiping it with a cloth from inside won’t do anything, wiping from outside still won’t help. My only guess is that they (dealership) didn’t clean/dry the glass properly before applying the tinted film. Is this a thing? When it isn’t raining I don’t get this issue",

Nothing preventing them from selling you a fried CPU that they bent the pins to make it seem like an easy repair will do it. In this case, car could be running in limp mode for a variety of reasons and I'm unsure it'd go on limp mode just because of an EGR delete, more likely would idle roughly but doubt with major issues. You may very well buy the car, tune it, and find out something else is very wrong. EDIT: So I didn't read correctly or whatever it can definitely go on limp mode on downpipe replacement. So it's plausible especially what he said about the ignition resetting the limp mode, likely sensors stuff. So yeah, might be an easy fix for someone who knows, but I'm not very informed on tunning and modifications, might as well go with a mechanic cause even if you work on your own cars, I wouldn't do the tune at home, especially if I've not confirmed if that's the issue or not.

I tried several times and got nothing. With the faulty starter, it would usually make a sound when trying to kick in, even if the engine did not start. After checking further, I noticed the 30A ignition fuse had blown. I replaced it, but it blew again a few days later. Then again today. I am assuming that as the starter motor has got worse, it is drawing more current and causing the fuse to blow.

It has to cool down for hours before it will start. It sounds like it doesn’t want to fire, it just cranks repeatedly. Sometimes it sounds like it wants to fire and the cranking gets faster for a split second before no longer firing. When that happens, I can tap the gas pedal and it will fire up. This makes no sense being a fuel injected car. If I don’t pump the gas when the split second attempt at firing happens, I’ve lost my window and have to wait for it to cool completely. One of my cylinders had a misfire due to a bad head, so the mechanic put a new head on it a few months ago. Not sure if that’s related. It always had a long crank before the head replacement but would start when warm. Now I don’t have the misfire anymore, but can’t start the car when warm. Any ideas?",

Everything has been going smoothly except for the issue with the fuel gauge, which is very very odd. The fuel pump and sending unit on these cars are 2 separate units instead of how the newer cars have them together. When I dropped the tank to clean the old gas out, the float for the old sending unit was just…floating around in there. So I got a new one and put it in. Only issue, it also doesn’t work very much. It will be stuck at 1 level only. Full or 3/4 of a tank. Naturally, I thought the thing was defective, so I took it out of the tank and moved the float manually while I had someone watch the gauge. Of course, it functioned as normal. Went to full, all the way back to empty, so I think that ruled out the gauge and the sending unit. Next, I thought it was getting stuck, so I dropped the tank again and checked it through the filler neck hole. I can put a long extension down in there and move the float real easy, so that couldn’t be it either and I’m honestly stuck on what to do. Any ideas? I’m going to college for being a mechanic and even the teacher hasn’t run into this issue.",

My mechanic is now telling me that I need a new idle air control valve and a new gasket for the metal housing. I KNOW OEM IS RECOMMENDED, but its just not possible, I've searched for hours and they are discontinued from Mitsubishi. I was wondering has anyone ever bought an aftermarket idle air control valve and it actually worked and worked for a couple of years at least or is it like 100% guaranteed to fail in the first year? I keep finding post that say they fail in a year so go OEM, but some people like me don't have that option.

That aside though, a flush uses an external machine and usually interfaces with the transmissions pump to intake/drain fluid at the same time to accomplish a COMPLETE fluid exchange. If you aren't doing a flush and just doing a drain and fill you'll need to do 2-3 cycles of drain-fill-operating temp & shift gears to get a pretty close to complete exchange. You also should replace the filter at least once. Once again though, draining the fluid is BENEFICIAL. Transmissions failing afterwards, is purely coincidental and usually a result of people waiting until it started making a bad sound or shifting weird to change their fluid.",

It would only jerk once. I took it to a repair shop back in November for diagnostics, but the mechanic was not able to replicate the problem after he fixed the other problems with my car(glazed belt; and changed the oil, transmission fluid change, and air filter), so he did not know what was wrong and told me I should not worry about it especially with the oil and transmission fluid change because it would be running better. While it did run better overall, the occasional jerk persisted. Forward to today on my way to the store, my car jerked three times in a row/all at once as opposed to the usual one jerk. On my way home, it did it again, but mutiple times, and I noticed it would do it when I'd accelerate. I was at two red lights, and each time, while stopped with my foot on the brake, it jerked once. I'm not sure what the problem could be. Any ideas? And is there a sure way to know what exactly the problem is? Also, with the weekend coming up I'm not sure if I would be able to get it fixed in time for my upcoming appointments on Monday and Tuesday. Monday I am going to be driving a total of 15 miles, and Tuesday 9 miles-- is it safe to do so? Would Id likely be able to make it home and back each day?",

They make a note stating the tires are larger than what’s recommended from the manufacturer. We didn’t notice the note. Last week, we took the van back because it sounded and felt like the bushings were bad already. They make us aware that the tires are too large causing it to strike the wheel well. He said it can be the cause of the bushings going bad this soon. He made it seem unusual that they went bad at 50k miles. The manufacturer recommends 235R and the tire shop put on 265R. I took it back to the tire shop today. They owned the mistake and are willing to replace the tires at no charge. I pushed for a $1,300 reimbursement for the bushings based on what the mechanic told me and what I’m reading online. Does anyone have experience with this or is there anything anyone can recommend to help me? Or is pursuing reimbursement for the bushings a pipe dream?",

This model, AFAIK, doesn’t have a separate serpentine belt tensioner, so there’s a screw attached to the alternator that pulls the belt tight. When I installed, I had to tighten the screw to a greater degree than how it was before (as you can see in the pic where the clean part where it was set before is quite different than where I had it set now). I double and triple checked the serpentine belt’s arrangement thru the pulleys, saw it was correct to the best of my judgement based on online diagrams and the photos I took before. I figured it was something particular about that serpentine belt, but yesterday noticed a squeal after starting the car when it’s been sitting overnight (50s, not too cold). Any ideas?

The sympthom: Cold engine, car starts just fine Warm engine, car starts just fine Half warm/cool engine the car struggles to start, crank really fast, rpms slowly reach idle. I've changed all the slark plugs (8), did an oil change, new battery, compression test, and checked live data and everything was okey. I checked valve clearance, it was okey, didn't need a change. I went to the mechanic with the car. The mechanic also have no clue what could be wrong but he suspects two things: Either one or more injector are faulty and leaking fuel into the combustion chamber. Or the AC is faulty, and the fuel pressure regulator is broken. The mechanic also noticed a clear smell of petrol when the car starts, which is abnormal. The idle is good, pulls great, doesnt eat oil, so the engine is in a good shape but we cannot find the route of the problem. Can you guys help please? #HONDA",

On this side, my doors don’t lock or unlock, so the front passenger side is always open, and I can’t open my rear passenger door. (If I lock my car and I open the front door, it will open however the alarm does go off.) My windows on this side also don’t work, whether using the passenger controls or the drivers controls. The mirrors are automatically meant to fold in when the car locks, however this does not work. I also have no mirror control on this side and can’t adjust them. Any ideas on how to solve the issue?",

Typically all of those lights are related with the wheel speed sensor, however if the battery was disconnected that could also trigger them and you just need to drive the vehicle above a certain speed to clear them. First thing is see what codes you have, OBD2 scanners are between $20-$50, or take it to autozone and they will scan it for free. Without a scan, you could…. If it is wheel speed sensor and not a battery issue, inspect the abs sensor wires going to each wheel if they look good, maybe pull out the speed sensor and clean the tip. While you have the wheel in the air, wiggle it around, if the bearing is bad it can set off those errors as well since the air gap on the speed sensor will be wrong. Good luck.",

Your idle issue could be due to anything from a timing issue, fuel delivery issue, vacuum leak, bad spark plugs, bad coils etc, could be a sensor somewhere telling the ECU to provide the wrong air fuel mixture (o2 sensor, MAF sensor).

I still have power to the end of the wiring harness and I can make the electronic parking brake actuator engage and release the parking brake with a 12 volt battery and jumper wires. Do the electronic parking brake actuators need to be recalibrated with a scan tool?

This happened when I was randomly trying to park my car 2 weeks ago. My car also would sometime not start right away and you have to hold the gas pedal to keep it from dying until it can idle, but would still idle low. I took my car over to my mechanic and he discovered that coolant was seeping through from one area of the throttle body into the area where the idle air control valve is located ( its not leaking from the outside in). He thinks this is the issue so he just did a coolant throttle body bypass because coolant is not needed in the throttle body where I live. Anyways after the coolant bypass the car does start and maintains idle at 700 - 800 rpm, but when you turn on the AC the idle drops to around 600 rpm and stays at 600 rpm. Then when you turn on the radio and fan and it drops to below 500 rpm triggering the check engine light. The car is not compensating for the additional load and raising the rpm like it should. Right now I think its either the coolant shorting out the idle air control valve so I just need to buy a new one or worst is that the coolant shorted out the idle air control valve which then screwed up the ECU. I read on a forum about this happening to people with Nissan Pathfinders. The same exact situation in which coolant seeped onto the idle air control valve and then over time that shorts out the idle air control valve which then causes a fuse to blow and destroy a capacitor or chip on the ECU. If my ECU did get shorted out by the idle air control valve shorting out from the coolant would my car still be able to start and run, but idle weird or would it not be able to start at all?",

They would first see if they can get reading through the OBD, and probe the output of the idle control valve with a multimeter or osciliscope to see if it correlates with what the ECU says. Finally, they would test the voltage at the sensor and the wiring between the sensor and ECU for any issues.",

    "selftext": "So I started driving in 2022 and learned on an 8th gen Honda Accord. I’m 6'3\", long-legged, and pretty much all my driving since has been in sedans. mostly the Accord and a W212 E-Class. Both of those cars just fit me. I like a low, knees slightly bent seating position with arms at a comfortable 120–130 degrees. Everything feels natural, and I can slip into that “flow state” on long drives without thinking about it. Now, here’s the problem: My dad has a 2023 (pre-refresh) Skoda Kodiaq, and we’re about to take it on a Delhi–Ladakh road trip(3500 kms). We’ll be splitting driving duties, 6to 8 hours of mountain roads every day, and despite having driven the car a decent bit, I just cannot get comfortable in it. I’ve spent hours trying every possible seating combo: Tried every seat height from lowest to highest Recline is fairly upright (my preference) Steering wheel is fully extended, and I still feel like I’m stretching when my legs are comfy If I move closer to fix that, my calves feel like they’re under constant tension when on the pedals. The end result? I feel like I’m either cramping my legs or overextending my arms. I’ve never had this issue in the Accord or the E-Class. Then there’s the visibility. Everyone raves about how SUVs give you a better view, but I feel less in control. I can’t confidently place the car, especially the front corners and rear thirds. I have no idea where the nose ends, and the rear-side visibility is just awkward. No flow state, no connection, just constant mental stress . For mountains driving in sports mode helps with body roll and allows a bit of engine braking which I like, but the throttle is way too sensitive even in Normal. Eco mode smooths it out a bit, but then I don’t have the power I need for overtakes in the hills, even with my foot buried. The problem is with the first 1/4th of the pedal where It jerks a decent bit and I don't have a good foot position on the pedal to get on it really smoothly like I can in the accord(also sensitive pedal). For context, I wear either my regular new balance shoes or puma motorsport driving shoes, same as what I use in the other 2 cars. Also, bonus frustration: I can’t play my usual music with my dad in the car, which really helps me focus while driving. That’s minor, but when everything else feels off, it adds up. Taking one of the other cars isn't an option as the accord has served its time and is going to be scrapped in a few days(in major Indian cities you can't have a petrol car registered for more than 15 years) and the E class doesn't have the ground clearance for some of the routes we are planning to go to. TLDR: Tall, long-legged driver used to low-slung sedans now has to drive an SUV (Kodiaq) on a big mountain trip. Seat/steering adjustments leave me uncomfortable no matter what. Visibility and throttle are frustrating. I want to enjoy this drive, but right now the car feels like it’s working against me. Any other tall drivers gone through this? Is this just an SUV thing? Is there a trick to adjusting posture in crossovers? Or do I just need to get used to it and stop overthinking? I really want a solution to this I'm just so fucking tired.",

Mechanically, it’s pretty sound, but in heavy rain it’s been leaking a TON recently. Unfortunately, the weather stripping for this year and model is no longer available, and I’m desperate at this point. My thought is, raise the top, caulk the entire inside, put it back down to let it set. Then also apply it on the outside where it comes down to attempt to fully prevent water from entering. This would render the convertible top basically useless, but I don’t really mind that. So, would this be a bad idea? Are there any potential repercussions I’m not considering that could have an adverse effect?",

What’s strange is that when I turn the key, the RPM needle shoots all the way to 8000 (max) instantly, even though the engine isn’t running. It cranks, but doesn’t start at all. Backstory: I installed a new battery around 3 months ago, so it shouldn’t be dead. Last night, due to some personal situation, I had to leave the car parked outside overnight in an open parking lot near a restaurant. When I came back today and opened the bonnet, I noticed the battery was a bit tilted/moved from its position. It almost looked like someone tried to open the bonnet or mess with it – kinda suspicious. Now I’m thinking – could someone have tampered with something? Or maybe the battery got damaged somehow when it shifted? Has anyone experienced something like this before? Any idea what could be causing the RPM to jump like that while the car won’t start? Really appreciate any suggestions.",

    "selftext": "**Built a Free App for Fellow Car Rental Owners — After 30 Days of Struggle 😅 (iOS + Web)** Hey r/Cartalk! 👋 I just launched something I wish I had years ago when managing my family’s small rental business got out of hand — it's called **SchedFolio**, and it's a **free app** I built to help folks like us manage our rentals without spreadsheets, confusion, or double bookings. ### 🚗 What It Does: * **Visual Dashboard** — See at a glance which cars are booked, overdue, or free * **Track Monthly Earnings & Payments** — Know how much you made, who rented, and how much you owe your agent * **Share Your Booking Link** — Let your loyal clients skip Turo and book directly from you * **Prevents Double Bookings** — Warns and blocks overlaps (this was a lifesaver) * **Multi-Asset Support** — Cars, vans, motorbikes — even non-vehicle rentals if you do those * **iOS + Web Sync** — Built to work solo or with a small team ### 🛠️ Coming Soon: * **Reminders & Alerts** — For pickups, drop-offs, maintenance * **AI Automations** — Auto-check-in/out, availability checks, and reminders * **Sync with other rental apps** — Not done yet, but I plan to add Turo/Airbnb-like integrations too ### 🧠 Backstory: This started as a weekend project to help with my own cars — turned into a 14-day grind, then a full-on 30-day battle. 😩 iOS rejections, bug hunts, sleepless UI overhauls… but I pushed through and launched. Honestly, I built this with my family in mind (they still rent out cars back home), but I figured others might find it helpful too. If you’ve got your own rental hustle, maybe give it a shot? 🆓 100% Free, No ads, No upsell — just something I needed, so I made it. Would love your thoughts or feature ideas 🙏 * 🌐 Web App: [https://schedfolio.com](https://schedfolio.com) * 📱 iOS App: [SchedFolio on App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/schedfolio/id6744385389) Thanks, and happy renting!",

Noise happens upon accelerating and seems to go away at higher RPMs in higher gear. My limited experience makes me think it could be something with the throttle being older or dirty, but I wanted to ask for insights from the community so I’m not aimless. It’s not a very new noise for this car. But I’ve gotten more into auto DIY over the last couple years and wanted to see if this buzzing noise was something I could diagnose and work on. Don’t mind the Bluey in the back from my toddler. My mic wouldn’t pic up the noise better in other clips without it for some reason.",

They called me and told me the tires are old and if I still wanna go forward with the adjustment. I said do it. (Tires were old but still had 5000 left on them. I replaced tires later too.) They \"did it\". He said the alignment wasn't that bad. That they adjusted it a bit. Drove it, the car is the same. Driving left on straight. Feels exactly the same. The steering wheel felt too tight and hard. Anyways. Took it to another firestone a week later (same tires, nothing changed). Tech came back and said he sees there are new suspension parts installed (i did not say it is the same as before). Showed me before and after and explained how bad it was and what he fixed. He said he can't do anything with the back as it is non adjustable. But the front was out of alignment. I took the car out, and voila. The steering wheel feels better, it goes straight, heck the light steering wheel shaking at 70mph even disappeared. So yeah. Some firestone places will take the money, do nothing and provide fake reports. Others are pure gold. Also their 1 year unlimited alignment plans are not unlimited.

Other information -for over a year my car would unlock/lock using the remote but randomly decides to not receive the signals. - SR performance intake is what I installed - ChatGPT says it could be a problem with the ecm.

Apparently on the passenger side, the rotor has been wearing unevenly which I can only attribute to rust maybe? (I had it shipped after moving and assume while in the process that side was exposed to the elements more than the other.) He said I’ve got about 80% life on my brakes but if he were to change the rotors I’d have to get new brakes, and that I should just wait until my brakes wear down and do it all at once but the squealing is annoying and I know it hurts everyone’s ears within a 5mi radius. He didn’t mention resurfacing but I see that’s a common fix but wonder if it’s possible if my other rotor is rusty and uneven. What’s my best option here? Is there a quick fix I can do to stop it from squeaking at least for a few months? TIA.",

    "selftext": "Apologies, tl;dr incoming but I am so frustrated. I have a 2013 Toyota Prius. A few weeks ago I got new tires (Michelin Defender T+H, which included alignment). I immediately noticed on the drive home that the car was pulling left - in order to go straight, I had to have the steering wheel tilted to the right. I went back in and they rechecked the alignment - lo and behold, despite telling me when I left the first time that it was perfect, one of the tires (the front right I think) was tilted. They fixed it and I headed home. The steering wheel now took me straight when it was straight, wonderful! However, over the next few days I noticed the steering wheel didn’t feel even on both sides. It is much easier (looser?) turning right than left. The wheel slowly moves back to neutral after turning right but snaps back to neutral (and then slightly beyond to the right) after turning left. I went back in and they told me this was likely due to “more aggressive treads” on the left and should settle as I drive more and wear them down. Both the mechanic and my advisor drove it around the lot and told me they noticed it but it was normal. But then last weekend I drove a 10-hour round trip and the entire time it felt like I had to physically pull the steering wheel to the left to keep it straight. Not a lot - I’m not wrenching the thing to the left or anything - but I have to exert small but continuous pressure (i.e., always pulling/pushing slightly to the left) to offset the way the wheel wants to tilt right (and thus take the car right now that it’s aligned). It’s most noticeable at highway speeds but I notice it on normal roads, too. The only way to get any relief was to ride in the fast lane and use the road's crowning to do the pushing for me. Is this really normal/likely due to treads pushing the steering wheel right? If so, how long can I expect this to last? Or could it still be an alignment issue or a tire that's defective? I know there are probably several reasons this could be, I’m looking for possible options to bring up if I take it back or just go to a new mechanic. I hate asking over and over for them to fix something they think isn’t an issue but if a tire could be defective I don’t want to lose out on some replacement period. I used to love driving long distances and now I dread it and feel like I’m fighting the car every moment of the drive, it’s even causing me some neck and shoulder strain. I feel like this is dumb because the pull is so minor but when I have to constantly maintain just a little pressure to keep the wheel straight, it adds up. I could really use some advice or reassurance that it will improve, I’ve already driven about 1,000 miles with no change.",

Small background details, my apologies if I know too much about late 90's BMW radios. This is the BMW MK4 navigation system used in 2003+ BMW 5 series and X5. In these cars there was a screen up front, navigation computer and radio (basically the same radio from a non-nav car without a screen or CD drive) in the trunk. If you wanted to put a more modern radio you need an extension harness from the trunk to the center console. What they did for MINI is put the navigation computer under the passenger seat and they used the same exact radio up in the center console. Same connectors on all the radios, it just takes the navigation voice input on one of the aux/cd changer slots. I think it could be made to work unless the cars have totally different dashboards. They probably mean the dash lights won't work, and why would you want them to when the nav car has a cluster somewhere else. How much effort would it take? I couldn't tell you. It might plug and play or you might need to swap some wires. It might just fit in place or you might need to swap all the support brackets behind the stock navigation and various dash trim pieces over to make things fit.",

Has 100,000 miles, the Enclave has broken tire sensors (all four), a replaced AC, and now a vibration that’s quoted at $1,394 to fix. Friends suggest selling to Carvana for $7,500 and using Uber/transit instead, saying its cheaper than the repair, insurance I'll pay ($900/6 mo), and parking permit. But Buicks often last until 200,000 miles, and I’ll definitely need reliable transportation for the next year. It seems smarter to make the repair and keep it until my long‑term needs are clear. What do you think? Is the $1,394 quote reasonable? That includes replacing rear tires (supposedly out of round) and engine motor (that shaking I see is abnormal and would cause vibration? I have no) Is it safe to drive? Thank you!",

I want the car to sound a bit more aggressive and refined than stock, but I don’t want it to be too loud or obnoxious. Ideally, I’d like something with a deeper tone and more presence, but still daily-drivable and comfortable on the highway. I went to a local exhaust shop and they gave me a few suggestions. One option was to remove the center resonator and replace it with an X-pipe. Another option they mentioned was to delete the two rear mufflers. They also brought up a setup they’ve seen before where Magnaflow resonators are installed in place of the center resonator along with an X-pipe. My biggest concern is drone, especially at cruising speeds. I want to avoid it as much as possible or keep it to a minimum. The shop said they weren’t sure how this platform responds to these changes in terms of drone, which makes me a little hesitant. My budget is around $400 maximum, and ideally I’d like to stay under that if possible. The shop also told me that the factory piping is 2.25 inches in diameter, if that helps with recommendations. If anyone has experience with this platform or has run similar setups, I’d really appreciate any advice. I’d also be interested in sound clips, specific part recommendations, or tips on keeping the tone sporty but still refined. Thanks in advance for your help!",

    "selftext": "So this may be kind of a weird question. But would like to have an affortable automatic car that does not creep when it's in gear. You know, when you shift into Drive, and you let go of the brake pedal, and the car will slowly move forward by itself. So I guess cars with this are mostly semi automatics (automated manuals). But even then, some manufacturers choose to artificially make the clutch behave like a torque converter and they programmed it in such a way that it will engage the clutch abit when the driver let go of the brake. But luckily not all semi automatics do that. Now I already know some semi automatics that don't creep: - first and second gen Smart Fortwo. - Fiat (grande) Punto from like 2007+. - some Citroën C4s from around 2010. - Citroën DS4. - Any Alfa Romeo with Selespeed tranny. - Mitsubishi Colt from like somewhere in the 00s. Not sure if that one creeps tho. Now you may say that many modern cars with automatics have a \"hold\" function, which basicly holds the brake for you. However that just covers the problem I have with traditional automatics rather than fixing it at the root. I want an automatic that when you drive and you let go of the gas, the car would automatically come to a full stop (if on a flat surface), instead of keep driving at 5-10 km/h.

    "selftext": "Hi All, I recently got into a bad accident on the NJ Turnpike. I was driving southbound in rainy weather, traveling in the center-left lane (in the truck lane). Just as I approached the merge with the car lane, my vehicle hydroplaned immediately to the right across three lanes of truck traffic. I hit the guardrail head-on then came to a rest in the shoulder facing north in the southbound lane. Interestingly the airbags did not deploy (I do not recall how fast the vehicle was moving at the time of impact). But thankfully my vehicle was the only automobile involved in the accident and I was uninjured. The vehicle front and sides sustained a good deal of damage and I have three flat tires. My insurance company towed my vehicle to an auto body shop near me in NY. My question for my fellow redditors - what advice do you have regarding the claims process with insurance? Any tips, wisdom, or suggestions? Anything I should be aware of? And when would you recommendI beginning the process of purchasing a replacement vehicle?",

    "selftext": "alright before anyone hops on and tells me it’s a bad idea, I already know. I don’t care though I just want my car gone. My girlfriend totaled her car when she was rear ended and in the in between time of dropping my insurance to start a new plan and combining her to mine, she totals mine (her fault this time) I still pay 150 car note and owe about 3k on it. This was about 5-6 months ago, I’ve since had to finance another vehicle for us to share. The same car sits collecting dust in my apartment complex that I’m paying off, it got towed for a week without me even knowing (another 600 down the drain). So, without a real title (I actually financed and brought it down from Wisconsin) how can I get rid of it while continuing to just pay it off? Make a Facebook marketplace post for parts or what?",

If you want to keep \"paying it off\" you could get a loan to pay it off then sell it but if that means more interest than your car note that would just be making your life harder as well. Was the insurance money from your car not enough to cover any of the loan on it? Or is 3k what you owe after paying what the insurance gave you for it? Why didn't insurance just keep the car since it was totaled? Did you buy it back? If you aren't allowed to keep it in the apartment lot anymore, then I would compare the cost of a loan with the new interest rate to how much it would cost compared to your current loan+current interest rate+ the cost of storing it somewhere else for the term of your current loan. That should help you determine which option is more cost effective for you.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m just wondering if anyone has had these issues and if so, what was the solution? My car issues started out of nowhere in February, where it suddenly shut off at a light and when I tried to start it, it would start for a second and shut off again, making it impossible to move or anything. After 15-20 min, it started again as normal and was completely fine for two weeks and the same issue happened. (I dont believe it is the battery since the screens and all were completely okay) A friend said it could be the fuel injector? So he recommended putting the cleaner into the tank and after that I experienced no issues until about three weeks ago. This time, the issue was as I was making my regular commute to work in traffic, the engine temp on screen rose suddenly, and all of a sudden i’m getting engine overheat alerts. I pulled over as soon as I could and shut the car off. The engine didn’t seem hotter than usual or anything and I turned the car on again in about 5 min. The engine temp was completely normal, which is weird if the engine was actually overheating? But then I drove off normally, and in 2 min the engine stalled like it did in Feb. Then it didnt happen for a while and now this past week on Thursday and Friday, I’m getting rapidly fluctuating engine temps & engine overheating alerts. I had brought it to the dealership I bought the car from and they told me they couldn’t find any issues with the car. Basically I was just told to call them when the issue is present. The problem here though is that the car has these issues for about 30 min, then it drives and presents completely normal by the time anyone will probably get to me. Has anything similar happened to anyone else? If so, please let me know what your solutions were! Thank you 😭 **in the attached video is a clip of when the car shuts off and engine wont turn on, and video of the engine temp fluctuating.",

        "body": "Either low on coolant causing pockets of hot air to hit the coolant temp sensor and make it fluctuate quickly, or a malfunctioning coolant temp sensor. Either way, modern cars go into limp-home mode, or shut off completely when they detect an overheat condition to try to protect the engine. Check your coolant level after the cars been cold for a good while. Look at the overflow reservoir and make sure the level is between the hot and cold levels on the bottle, or at least at the cold line if it's been sitting for hours. Also could check the radiator level, but make sure the cars been sitting for a few hours before removing that cap, as it can erupt hot coolant onto you if you take it off too soon after driving. If your levels are good, you don't see any coolant leaks in the engine bay or on the ground, and you don't see billowing white clouds of steam come out of your exhaust, it's probably safe to assume the coolant temp sensor or circuit has a problem. Your AC conpressor will leak condensation onto the ground, so if you see a single puddle of just water, it's probably not coolant. But give any puddles that accumulate under the car a sniff, as coolant has the distinct smell of antifreeze. I wouldn't drive the car until you can get it to the dealership, but whatever issue you may have should be covered under warranty. Make sure to show them this video so they don't just get in the car take it around the block and tell you \"couldn't replicate issue\"",

She wouldn't press the brake pedal hard while waiting at a red light, just enough to not move, and the engine would \"idle\" at 1000-1100 rpm. I asked her to press harder on the brake, and my suspicion was confirmed. The engine dropped to 7-800rpm. This was with auto start stop turned off.

No of course the the downside of that is you do have to choose which firmware you want to run every time you start the car., but that's a small price to have to pay to get all that other cool s*** happening. Now the neat thing is you can also set it up so that it will always boot up in your Android firmware, but you do have to hook up a USB drive to get it so that when you restart the car it will restart and factory firmware. If you're in warranty, you're going to want to be able to do that before you take your car to the dealer. If you have any types of subscriptions like navigation or satellite radio, those will still work through the firmware update. You just have to re login to those. Which is why using the USB drive method to turn the firmware on and off and to keep it from you saying yes every time you start the car, it's again a small price to pay.",

Luckily, I have an \"R\" button I can program all my settings to, so I just have to double press that after I start the vehicle, and go on my way.

Bottom line, I feel it’s just a marketing scheme that sounds innocent enough as it can appear to be geared towards helping the consumer when in reality it’s just wearing the car out faster so they have to buy parts and maybe even get labor from those on a lease or buying from the dealer wanting it “done right” So to answer your question, yes I shut it off every time, even when driving my parents vehicles if we go on a trip.

        "body": "Everyone complains about features that increase fuel efficiency because they don't like them, but here's something to think about. If manufacturers didn't develop these technologies (auto start/stop, active fuel management, CVTs, hybrid technology, DCTs, etc) we would not have the performance that we enjoy today. Whether it's small displacement turbo engines or large displacement cam-in-block engines, these technologies allow for MPG and performance that could only be dreamed of 25 years ago. In 2000, the base Camry made 136hp and got 23 mpg (EPA city). You could cough up an addition $2K and get the V6 that made 194hp, but your mpg dropped to 20. Today that same model comes with 203hp and gets 28mpg. The V6 makes 301hp and gets 22mpg. The LS and LT engines from GM would not exist today were it not for auto start/stop and AFM. Those technologies allow a 500hp car to get pretty impressive REAL WORLD fuel mileage. For example, a 2000 Silverado made 285hp and got 14mpg (EPA city). A 2024 Silverado makes 355hp and gets 17mpg. Compare the highway mileage and that number is 17 and 24mpg. And the 2024 Silverado can easily weight 500lbs more than the 2000. All I'm saying is that without these technologies--in spite of the problems--driving today would be a sad affair.",

Of course, most anti pollution systems must stay, but start stop is horrendous for the engine, and it isn't good for the environment. Properly done gasoline direct injection with port injection, and mild turbos, these are good for everyone. Low tension piston rings are just terrible, they reduce engine life immensely, same as wet belts, for very little gains. But we did get mild hybrids with reinforced starter engine that can add 4/6Hp from stopped. For small cars it is amazing, and we got that from crappy start stop,so we do get advancement.",

It gives nothing to each individual buyer in savings. Get rid of the CAFE standards. A company shouldn't have to build cars and trucks they don't want to just to make a number. Other companies shouldn't be able to sell their credits because they only want to make cars that exceed the standards. It's just dumb.

Brakes aren't all that difficult, but if you're not careful you'll be rolling through stoplights and stop signs in no time. Again, it's something you can do, But he's right to caution you. Most other things in terms of repairs will make the car so it doesn't go. This is the opposite problem. Here are the things that are likely going to be problem spots - You're going to have a hell of a time getting the wheel off. You're going to have a hell of a time getting the calipers off and putting the new ones on. Get some extra brake fluid, because you'll need to flush the line. (DO NOT GET IT ON THE PAINT, IT WILL STRIP IT). Things to have that you might not think you'll need. A better jack than probably the one you have. I'd recommend buying some jack stands you may have to donkey kick the tire, and you don't need the cheap emergency one failing you. A better tire iron than you probably have. An extra bottle of DOT 3 brake fluid Crescent wrenches, a screwdriver set Black Gloves A light A piece of cardboard to sit on A tray for parts A blow torch Rust remover A wire brush/steel wool. Paper towels A funnel A small bucket. Your brake pads The lube for the pads (to keep them from squeaking) They sell a caliper clamp that is supposed to hold it back so you can put the pads in. You can buy it or not, but if you tear the rubber boot around the caliper, you're going to need to replace that. Your phone - Not just to check the youtube video again, and again, and again, but to take photos of the rotor. If it's got deep grooves in it, the pads aren't going to help.",

You can try and re-seat the bumper clips, in case they got knocked loose but not cracked/destroyed, that would save you the cost of a replacement bumper. Then, buff out the scratches and wash off the paint transfer. Fixing the paint transfer will make the whole thing a lot less noticeable. The bent metal will be very difficult to fix, but if the plastic is bent at all, you can try to push it back into shape after heating it. Some people use heat guns or boiling water for that, that's tricky and risky, a hair dryer or even just a hot day are typically sufficient in my experience to make the plastic malleable. Some people are recommending oddball things, like using caustic chemicals to remove the paint transfer. Don't do that, or at least don't start with that. Try to remove it with soap and elbow grease first, you would be shocked by what just comes off without needing any extreme treatment. Best of luck in any case - in my somewhat-handy opinion, this will be a pretty difficult repair to make look nice.",

If you didn't read it, it's here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1kg2z7e/disappointed\\_with\\_full\\_detail\\_am\\_i\\_being\\_picky/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1kg2z7e/disappointed_with_full_detail_am_i_being_picky/) So I went back to the company that did the \"detail\" the day after. No yelling or rudeness etc, I just showed them all the stuff they didn't touch and explained that I wasn't satisfied. They didn't seem very interested in doing anything more to the car (they said they were fully booked for the next few weeks, their online booking didn't agree with that) but they did offer a refund so in the end I only paid for the exterior detail, which I was reasonably happy with as they did an okayish job with that. I obviously won't go back there though. I have this week off work (I work away from home every other week) so I decided to try to do it myself. Ordered some stuff, the refund covered most of it, and went to work. Bear in mind that this is just a total beginner working in his unpaved driveway, but I still feel it's a major improvement. The more obvious stuff like door pockets, dashboard, interor trim, trunk mat etc were obviously just a matter of wiping/brushing the dirt off. The side mirror came back better than I had expected considering it's 40 years and 200K miles old and honestly in need of replacement. They had obviosuly spent an absolute minimum of work on the seats and carpets. Some comments suggested they were simply worn out, but as you can see the seat came back nicely as well. I did my best with the engine bay and it's at least a huge improvement, although I need something else to get the glue residue off the firewall. The car is obviously old, well used and in dire need of a new paint job, but I still think the \"turd\" looks pretty nice.",

    "selftext": "Hello. I have a 2017 Chevy Cruze Hatchback LT. I think it's a 1.4 liter engine. I've had it for about 6 years. My car decided to take a crap on me an hour away from home. Somehow managed to get it back on and drive it home. Long story short, had to take it to the dealership to get worked on. Turns out my vacuum pump seal broke which damaged my camshaft and made the brake booster lose all power. The tech told the service dept. person I was working with that he doesn't know how I drove it home. They replaced my camshaft, the vacuum pump, a pcv orifice pipe, my spark plugs, and required an oil change. I've had the car back for about a week or so now. I can physically feel how much better the car drives. It shifts better (not as much jerking), the car doesn't shake at 75+ mph anymore, it doesn't hesitate to go when I press on the gas pedal, no more rough idling. I'm happy! But... Sometimes when my auto stop feature starts, when I go to let off the brake it takes a second to crank on.. like it's not super crazy, but the auto stop feature should absolutely just be able to turn the engine on instantly right? I don't recall my car doing this before. Turning the car on from it being completely off is the same too. Sometimes it takes a second or two of cranking before kicking on. Could it just be that it's learning the new parts since it went God knows how long with broken ones? I've not been able to take it on a long drive yet, just 2-3 15 minute trips to and from work everyday and maybe the store around the corner. I've watched my battery voltages during it to see if it was battery related (still need to get into my trunk to check the actual battery to ensure it's tight-- it was messed with when I first broke down because we were trying to see why the car died). When driving I'm around 13-14.5 V and when the auto start kicks on it drops IMMEDIATELY to 12-12.5V but then charges up just fine when the car starts running again. So I don't think it's battery related. Everything else google says is something I have no clue how to check or just seems a bit confusing/not on the mark. Is this worth going back to the dealership about? Is this a wait and see type of thing? Worth getting the check engine light codes checked out? (The check engine light is NOT on but I read that it still can have codes thrown). Please help! Thank you so much in advance!",

        "body": "First, learn to use paragraphs. It's inconsiderate to expect people to read a wall of text. I would not take a 2017 Cruze to a dealership. Those repairs must have cost a fortune. Dealerships are well known to rip people off. Find an independent mechanic with good reviews. Do not use a franchise place like Goodyear, Firestone, or whatever. The voltage fluctuations may be normal for your car. The voltage will drop when starting due to the load of the starter cranking the motor. I'm not a 2017 cruze expert, so I Googled this issue as you should have done already. It seems the most common issue is the battery. Do you know how old the battery is? You can go to an auto parts store like O'Reilly, and they can test the battery while it's in the car. The 2017 Cruze stop/start feature is known to have issues. If the car is running fine except for the stop/start feature, consider buying this stop/start eliminator off Amazon for $12. You don't need special tools. Just plug it in: https://a.co/d/bt9Quw3 Instructions on how to install it: https://a.co/d/bt9Quw3 Good luck!",

        "body": "Cool, tip noted. You'll see I took your advice for this comment. You're right I know, but that's the thing lol I did take it to an independent mechanic (great reviews by word of mouth and online) who did the research and looked into my car/forums and helped me out but did not have the correct machinery to work on my car. He's the one who suggested the dealership and ensured I had all the information beforehand so I wasn't screwed over. I also called the dealership out on the markup of pricing of their parts and they matched them and my independent mechanic said the total price I paid was correct and would have been about the same at his shop. I'm trying to do everything right. I have been googling religiously. I'm coming here as a last resort. I have googled every question under the sun it feels like and cannot find a straight answer that matches what's happening to me. I just was trying to see if anyone else had experienced this. My next step is going to AutoZone tonight after work and getting it tested as well as the engine codes to see if it is throwing anything that I can look into deeper. It's not just the auto start function, it happens when turning the car on as well so I don't think it's just that. I appreciate you trying to help and giving me advice. Have a good day.",

    "selftext": "I have a 2016 Toyota Avalon and it just hit 150k miles. I love my car and want to give it some love to run as long as possible. Currently it has 2 issues: 1. Catalytic converter dissolving -toyota dealership told me it would cost $5,000 and advised to go somewhere cheaper - i found multiple parts online to order and bring to someone but how do i know which is best?? 🫣 - how do i determine a good price for work on a car? (never done this before) 2. Cruise control stopped working close to when the engine light came on for the converter - i’ve heard different things from different people/ some say the cruise control is separate from the converter and others say as long as the light is on it won’t work - is there a way to get the sensor fixed separately before i get the converter fixed? 3. apart from regular oil changes, taking care of tires- anything i can do to care for it extra?",

Problem is, we don’t know the last time the ATF fluid was changed. We know it has been changed. But we don’t know how often or at what mileage. And I know it gets risky to change once 100k or more miles have built up on the same fluid - Please correct me if I’m wrong. Is there a way for me to check without doing drain and fills and risking killing the transmission? Like, can I siphon out a little bit with a syringe and send it to a lab or something? Maybe the lab can give me an analysis with an estimate on how many miles are on the fluid?",

The dodge Journey and the Mitsubishi Lancer X are on the same platform… YOU CAN SHARE PARTS WITHOUT MIRRORING THE ENTIRE DESIGN.

You could see all around, the D16 was not fast but the car was light so it felt nimble. It had ABS, but it let me drive. When it broke, it was mechanical. Never was a computer having a fit and throwing problems that required specialized tools. I fixed that car with $50 worth of tools from any hardware store. Sadly I had to sell that car when I moved from Mexico back to Canada. Now I have an 09 Civic DX sedan and while it feels a lot bigger than my 6th gen, it's a lot of the same story. I had a 2011 Honda fit that had traction control and that was kind of nice in the winter. Fortunately I was able to turn it off when I wanted. My 2008 Cobalt had traction control and the only way to disable it was the trick the car into thinking I had the handbrake pulled. My father has a 2022 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk and it literally rips the wheel from his hand when he tried to avoid a suddenly stopped car on the highway. It manged to stop the Jeep and we didn't hit anybody, even luckier there was nobody behind us but holy shit was that scary. The two lanes to the left were clear and the Jeep wouldn't let him make the safest decision. Backup sensors and automatic braking drive me wild. I understand that these features largely assist the average person, but as a driving enthusiast can I get a car that doesn't have all that shit?

Capacitive physical buttons, like the Chevy Volt, are also unacceptable. HVAC, radio, and glovebox (!!!) are the biggest ones for me. BMW/MINI and my '14 Odyssey had physical input controllers for on-screen interaction and that is acceptable. Even if the screen is touchscreen. I understand the motivation as cost savings though. And certainly a bad UI could, in theory, be completely replaced by a better design. I don't mind the fake exhaust so much once I was clued in that a minor rear end accident could damage the drivetrain upstream if the exhaust was longer. It's a simpler (cheaper) solution than engineering a weak point in the exhaust system and reduces the cost of repairs in that situation. I'm also not mourning the loss of the shifter since everything is automatic now anyway. I like shifters, and appreciate my manual cars, but pushing a button, sliding a thing, rotating a dial ... unless I'm in a situation where I would change gear selection frequently, I just don't see why it's a problem. Paddle shifters are a fine solution for sporty driving.",

However, drive normally and every now and again a massive series of loud beeps, my music shuts off and my whole heads up display flashes like a fucking incoming torpedo warning, which in itself has almost caused an accident. Was able to turn off lane correction, lane departure warnings (cause ontario, we drive on whats left of a road...) but no, cant turn off collision warning, cant permanently set the stop/go engine shut off to \"off\". Honestly id have rather spent 90k instead of 50k and bought a truck that was intended to be sold to the commercial market...bare bones, no fancy bullshit. Engine starts, got lights, sweet were golden. Yeah heated seats are nice, and so is a backup camera. But i only like those cause they dont yell at me!",

        "body": "I’m on board with Doug Demuro’s take on the gear shifter situation. There is no need for a traditional automatic gear shifter, and replacing them with fully electronic, button based shifters has more benefits than the big shift lever could ever offer. What benefit does the traditional gear shifter offer you? I’d argue it’s only the perceived emotions of some amount of manliness, toughness, ruggedness, etc. The transmissions themselves are fully electronic these days, so a big shift knob isn’t doing anything that a button can’t do. They used to have a bit more of a mechanical operation, but that’s been gone for generations of vehicles at this point. The button shifters can allow for more room for other features; usually cup holders/storage in the center console area. But the biggest thing they can offer is safety. It can be very easy for an automaker create the automatic shift to park as soon as the driver door is opened with a fully electronic shifter. I believe it was tried with a traditional shifter, but it’s much easier to implement with a button based shifter versus a moving shift lever.",

My 2011 Edge was Peak Car, Had all the modern convenience's without going overboard. • Auto Cruise adjustment and brake alert, but using a sensor in the front bumper not the windshield it only ever failed during big blizzards, my bronco sport freaks out if the sun hits it the wrong way or you get a bug splatter anywhere near the sensor in the window. And when it did have an issue, you cleared the error then it went away until restart... Now My bronco pings every 5 mins, like I get it theirs bug guts on the window but I'm not stopping in the middle of rush hour freeway traffic to scrub the window so STFU! about it. • Bluetooth audio but without all the Carplay/android auto nonsense, if you needed nav you just got audio directions via google maps on your phones bluetooth. • Actual Shifter, not this dial nonsense. • Actual Twin exhaust pipes. • Auto Rear hatch but it was a button on the inside (one to the left of the steering wheel, one on the side by the rear door) or fob none of this under bumper foot sensor crap. What's next? gotta ask Alexa to open your doors? • Actual buttons, with extras on the steering wheel, ok they were touch buttons without the tactile feedback but still, that being said one of the reason I got the Bronco sport after my edge got written off was that the dash has tactile buttons on it, not just a giant tablet. • It didn't have a F'n tracking device built in, Luckily I found the fuse and disabled the Tattletale Control Unit. I bought a car, I didn't sign up to have Ford listen to everything I say and do, and get every false-positive bug splat windshield error code to share with whoever willing to buy that data. F Ford Pass, never needed it before, don't need it now. (Fun Fact every-time I've taken it in the dealer has \"Fixed it for free\", I have collection of 5amp fuses now). • And a Mother F'n CD Player.

Also why is every manufacturer too cheap to get a different unlock chime? Literally EVERY car uses the same one now.

I was heavy on the gas peddle not long before i hit it and i felt a slight hesitation when it went to downshift. Right after hitting it, when speeding up the car started to stutter and hesitate when giving it throttle. Turned around and drove it straight to the dealer. They looked at it and said the pothole shocked the car and broke the coil pack. I've never heard of this before, and just last thursday I had the spark plugs replaced by the dealer. Should I believe them, or could they have damaged the coil pack when changing the spark plugs? This dealer has not had the best of service, they had replaced the front and back brakes (disk and pads) when the spark plugs got changed last week. Walked out after paying and the back brakes already had grooves that my finger nail would catch on, so they took it back and replaced them again. Thank you to anyone that helps.",

Anything is possible, but no, hitting a pothole and an ignition coil coming loose is not some normal thing that happens. Even people getting in actual wrecks don't typically have the ignition coils lose contact. They messed up, but good luck getting them to admit to it.",

Dirty throttle body can cause \"suddenly turns off while driving\", especially on deceleration and low speed scenarios. The dirty/sludged up throttle plate rim restricts airflow into the engine or can possibly block all airflow depending on the angle - causing a shutoff You won't notice symptoms when accelerating because the throttle body plate opens wider when the gas pedal is pressed - allowing the necessary airflow to keep the engine running. But at low speeds and during braking, the throttle plate closes - cutting off the air Oh and it doesn't set a check engine light or codes usually. Ask me how I know 😅... I was chasing my tail for weeks when my old Jeep started randomly stalling at stoplights, turned out the throttle body was dirty/gummed up and the engine could barely breathe Anyways, it's something you can check for free",

Take it to a shop and have them do a scope into the cylinders and see what condition it is and if all is good then have them seal up your oil leak.

I got it because it was cheap and i just needed a commuting car. Here’s my issue: I don’t want to go to a dealer and spend upwards of $700 bucks to get two keys. I need a more affordable option that i’m sure will work. I looked online and saw that a locksmith might be able to do it but i’m not entirely sure how anything works.

    "selftext": "I have been having a reoccurring problem with my 2013 Subaru Impreza where my key would get stuck in the ignition. I have taken it to a shop but they couldn't recreate it because it isn't completely consistent, just regular The exact issue is that I can't turn the key from the ACC position to the lock position to remove it. I have tried wiggling the steering wheel, making sure it was in park, turning the wheel, so many things but it isn't working. Sometimes I do nothing, turn the key to on, and then I can take it out again. I plan to take it to the shop again when I can but I can't for a bit. The actual key part of the key is loose with the actual fob, can this be the issue? Thanks for any help you can give Edit: I eventually managed to get my normal key out, and I used a spare back up key I have. That key also got stuck so that isn't it. I got the normal key out right after moving my gear shifter around for a bit. I got the backup key out after wiggling the steering wheel. Before both of these I tried both of those solutions and they didn't work until they suddenly did.",

I bought a Dorman kit for the oil filter housing, which was the main cause of the leak, and I also bought spark plugs.

A couple of weeks ago I suspect that my power steering also put too much load on the car causing the rpm to get stuck at around 500 which was the reason why my car was at the mechanic in the first place. I was trying to park my car so I was turning the steering wheel a lot which was engaging the power steering.

    "selftext": "Around 93k miles, I DIYed a transmission fluid and filter change for a 2016 Mazda CX-5. That procedure involved removing the RTV sealant gasket that came from the factory, doing the service, and replacing with the cellulose gasket that came with [this filter](https://www.rockauto.com/en/moreinfo.php?pk=11963321&cc=3312788&pt=8600). I scraped the sealant, used brake cleaner and isopropyl alcohol to prep the surface. I do remember having a tough time keeping the gasket aligned to the pan, especially when the gasket was stored tangled in a box for a month or so. I managed to have it reasonably aligned, and torqued the transmission pan bolts to 7-10 Nm (62-88 inch-pounds or 5.2-7.4 ft-pounds). No leaks immediately after completion... https://preview.redd.it/x0ipi7a9z60f1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5c04bf353c976b76fcd1d85db5d880ee76439ce https://preview.redd.it/g108ca6bz60f1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc735b8be9f66729ed84041fdeed29eaba15f5a7 Then about a month or so later, I noticed a minor leak, and upon further inspection (see photos) noticed that the gasket has split around the bolts. There are many instances of the gasket being split like that around the pan. I'm wondering what I can do better when installing the next gasket. According to the product page linked prior, one thing I did not do was \"Apply [Multi Purpose Grease](https://www.rockauto.com/en/tools/garage+equipment,fluid+/+chemical,multi-purpose+grease,16795) or [Rebuild Lubricant](https://www.rockauto.com/en/tools/transmission-automatic,fluid+/+chemical,transmission+rebuild+lube,1001874) to the edges of the fluid plan to hold the new gasket in place during installation\". There also may be a difference in the torque spec of the RTV sealant v. the other gasket?",

Brakes were working fine until I was having to start pushing all the way down for them to engage. While looking for a safe spot to pull off the brakes did have a few instances where they were fine, but would go back to me having to push all the way down to the floor to for them to work. Finally pulled over on the interstate and immediately checked to see if there was a leak and didn’t see anything. At this point the wife is freaking out asking what is wrong. Told her could be air in the lines or the master cylinder failed. Ended up getting the car towed back to town to the local shop. Fast forward to about an hour ago. Guy from the shop called and said the he couldn’t reproduce the issue that I had experienced . Said he didn’t see any leaks and that there was plenty of fluid as well. When I mentioned the master cylinder he said when those go bad they go bad and not cut in and out like I was experiencing (whether or not this is true I dunno lo).

I'm hoping you guys can offer some suggestions of mods/improvements that I should look at for this vehicle. In order of cost & effort, I'm considering: Tearing off that bright red reflector strip on the rear lol, Phone mount, dash cam, interior lights, Carplay unit, Window tint, LED headlights, bright yellow wrap. The car also doesn't have a cigarette lighter/any way to charge my phone so if you know anything about fitting that lmk.

I did notice the upper radiator hose that returns to the engine was broken, so I replaced this hose and the issue persists. My coolant reservoir was also more full than usual, it was near the hot fill line while being both hot and cold. I drained the coolant and refilled it to the cold line and it still doesn’t rise with heat. The drained coolant was normal color. The radiator does spin and it seems like once it does start spinning is when the overheating really starts. Does this seem like a thermostat or a water pump issue or maybe a blockage somewhere, the thermostats aren’t super hard to replace on this car so I’m gonna work on that next just would like some other input from more experienced people.",

It’s possible the mechanic didn’t properly clean and grease the caliper guide pins during the brake job, which would cause the caliper to stick and the outer pad to wear out much faster than normal. Skipping that step or rushing the install is an easy way for this kind of damage to happen. It’s also possible the caliper was fine at the time of the brake job and just started sticking afterward, which would be bad luck rather than the shop’s fault. Either way, the rotor is likely ruined now, and the car will need a new rotor, new pads, and at least a new caliper on that side. It would also be smart to replace both front calipers at the same time since they’re fairly cheap for a Camry. How many miles ago was the job done? How long ago was it as well?",

    "selftext": "I have a 2011 Mercedes Benz that started showing a white temperature symbol and the car's temperature goes up to around 100 degrees at which point the radiator fan starts very loud and the temperature drops to around 90 degrees and the white temp symbol goes away. I've done a ton of reading and I've found that there are 3 possible reasons why this happens, one is a bad coolant temp sensor, two is a bad radiator fan and three would be a bad AC pressure sensor. I started checking the car and realized the coolant temp sensor connector was broken, since I work as an Engineering Tech I had some wires with female pins laying around that fit perfectly on the two coolant temp sensor so I decided to get rid of the bad connector and connect the coolant temp sensor directly to the two wires after removing the connector. I tested the car by driving it around for around 1 hour and the first thing i noticed is that the tempersture doesnt go all the way up to 100 degreed anymore but the white temp symbol still pops up on my dashboard, mind you i live in LA and today's temperature was the high 90s. The second thing I noticed is that when the white temp symbol pops up the AC stops blowing cold air, when the fan starts blowing real loud the white temp symbol goes away and the AC starts blowing cold air again, however the temperature shown in the temp gauge doesn't go above 90 degrees. I've checked and made sure the radiator fan works, I've made sure there's enough coolant in the reservoir, I don't see any coolant leaks coming from the thermostat or from the water pump, I'm not sure how to go about troubleshooting this problem, the only thing I have not checked is the AC pressure switch because I don't know what role this switch/sensor plays in all of this. Does anyone have any suggestions or advise, I don't see any error codes related to the radiator fan or coolant temp sensor with my ODB II scanner. I've attached 2 images of the white temp symbol and the temp gauge as I was driving back from the car wash today, as you guys can see the temperature doesn't look high enough to throw that symbol, but maybe I am missing something.

As the water cools the thermostat should close again to reduce the amount of coolant flowing in the system. If the thermostat is stuck the fans have to pick up the slack of cooling the engine which also means rerouting from AC work to engine cooling. Edit: Removing the thermostat will drain the coolant loop so you'll need to top it off with the correct coolant. Otherwise just do a full coolant flush and replace. The bottom of the radiator usually has a drain plug to remove the rest of the coolant from the system",

I would like to not pay rent due to me about to be a full time college student. and I would like to keep the cars and not sell them as they are my life and I love them.

For example if you buy Denso it's a high quality brand that makes OE parts, but if you buy Pure Energy they are a low quality brand and the parts going to be low quality Not all parts they sell are reman, and not sure where you found the reviews of the site but that's shockingly low lol",

I paid once for the starter and have replaced it 5 times for free. the first time it died I bought some starter without a lifetime warranty that probably last 2 years before it started to fail. went with the lifetime warranty and never paid an extra cent since swapping them in and out. tldr get a lifetime warranty from a reputable place locally that will stand behind their warranty.",

I’m curious if it could be a bad pump or the steering rack, or anything someone could possibly think of that would cause so much pressure on the system like that.

Two days ago i got out of work and went to start my 328i bmw when it wouldn’t start. the key worked and the locks too but when i put the key in and pushed the start button it would just make a clicking sound. so my dad came and jumped it and it started right up like normal and i drove it home. we just put a new battery in it back in march so we thought maybe it was a faulty battery. we took it back with the receipt and got a replacement. yesterday it started right up like normal and i drove it twice, but after less than an hour later when i went to drive it again, it clicked again but this time all the electronics came on for a split second before everything just completely shut off and the key became stuck. i managed to pull it out without anything breaking but now absolutely nothing works or turns on. the only sign of life is the emergency blinker button is flashing really really fast. jumping it isn’t working so as of right now we can’t even get to the battery because it’s in the trunk and we can’t open it. has this happened to any of you? if so, what could it be and how can it be fixed?

There is a hidden menu on the E90 so you can see it on the dash if you don't have a multimeter (you should probably still get one). IIRC voltage will cycle between 13 and 14.5ish on that car. If it doesn't, you have a problem with your alternator. If it does, look elsewhere (parasitic loss, IBS, etc.). Common IBS issues manifest as all kinds of silly things - blower randomly shutting off is the obvious one I've encountered. You can unplug its signal wire if that's the issue. IBS can prevent the car from starting if it's borked. You can use a multimeter to check for parasitic drain. There's a spec somewhere on allowable current with everything off (it takes a few minutes after turning the car off), which I'm sure you can find in a service manual or with a little Googling. Note: If replacing the alternator, you'll want to pull off or inspect the original to make sure you're getting the right replacement, because the two different makes have different pulleys. Make sure you get new bolts as aluminum bolts are one-time use and they must be aluminum because the block is magnesium. Use a torque wrench. Source: E90 owner for many years and 150k+ miles 👍",

Also the offset range is the same (37-41). [Wheel-size.com](http://Wheel-size.com) tell me that it should work. I just want a second opinion before I buy it.

    "selftext": "I drive a 2007 Toyota 4runner. Brake lights stay illuminated when the vehicle is off. When the vehicle is on they do not reflect when the breakers are depressed and not. I’ve replaced the brake light switch but the lights still do not go off unless I disconnect the connection to the brake light switch. Additional info: I replaced the bulbs in my tail lights because the driver side was out. After replacing the brake light bulbs it resolved the issue while it was in park but in drive the driver side tail light still wouldn’t work. I ordered a brake light switch to replace it and while waiting for the part to deliver my check engine light came on, ABS, and my VSC trac. Also while my car was off, I removed the brake light switch and depressed the plunger with it still connected to verify the brake lights went off and they did. I haven’t noticed any weird resistance when braking and I honestly can’t tell if the brake pedal comes all the way forward or not? So it’s my brake pedal or brake fluid possibly? Or something else, fuse maybe? I’ve been overcharged at mechanics before for being a woman or told them what I thought the issue was, they’d say it wasn’t that, and I was back in a month replacing the same thing I thought it was.

Heating any pump up to operating temp can reduce operation noise. Heating up a bad pump can significantly reduce excessive noise as heat can improve sealing capability and operating tolerances, as well as THIN the oil especially if it's significantly worn oil. Sounds from pumps don't necessarily mean they're on their way out, but they can be good indicators. Yes it could be a belt, pully/tensioner included, ac clutch, and then some. The best way to trouble shoot is with a stethoscope or other sound amplifier, or with the engine off remove the belt and start spinning and wiggling all the pulleys listening for sounds and wobbles. It depends. But absolutely possible.

Turn on the car and cycle through the gears, then let the transmission come up to temp (usually 200f of so). You'll need a scan tool or ODBC reader to see the transmission temp. Then add back more fluid until it starts coming out of the drain hole. The important bit is that the car MUST BE LEVEL while doing the final fill.

Changing the transmission fluid in a modern automatic requires special fluid (if the wrong one is bought it can cause anything from check engine light or limp home mode to catastrophic transmission failure), usually a special multistep process that must be done at specific temperatures, and access to a mechanic's computer that can set it to rapid relearn once the process is complete.",

The service center says the likely cause is a poorly sealed sunroof and clogged drains. Now the car is throwing a ton of system errors and they’re recommending a full teardown to diagnose potential module damage. What’s frustrating is that I had this same shop inspect the car within a week of buying it and they gave it a clean bill of health (just did an oil change and replaced the cabin filter). Insurance is involved and will cover costs going forward, but I’m still frustrated and unsure what to expect. Has anyone dealt with something similar? What would you do in my shoes?",

I obtained the repair manual from allcarmanuals d.ot com. Here are the front brake specs: https://preview.redd.it/oru1vu1vvxze1.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=37a235924acd8d13ebb3e2490fa9f7654ed626ca The disc pads should be (area x thickness) 4,010 x 12.0 Makes sense, ok. So the thickness should be 12.0 milimeters. It seems that I can't find any \"fitting\" pads that are even remotely close to these dimensions. Let me give you an example: autodoc do.t uk is a well-known european retailer of car parts. When I input the car there, and look for brake pads, select the front axle, they are all A LOT thicker: https://preview.redd.it/66cohubkwxze1.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ae46863ecda3d90b22d944d7e2a3c74e43d7a7 See this? These are 6.5mm thicker. That's over half a centimeter! I have significant doubts over whether these will fit. And I can't find others that would fit. In fact, I searched over 10 retailers. They always give values for pads that are way too thick for this car (?) Now, clearly, I'm a noob, so I ask you, please, help me figure out what I'm missing. In addition to all this, I also searched for the discs for this car. While I was able to find a couple results that fit the service manual, 80% of the results were way off. How are they meant to fit? I tried countless sites - surely they can't all be wrong? Can they? Thanks a lot in advance.",

Chances are they are either badly corroded or broken. If they are not, start checking connections from your starter to make sure it's getting 12v and is grounded appropriately.

    "selftext": "Hi all, Today, I managed to replace the air intake tube (that connects the air filter housing to the engine). However, in the process of taking out the air filter housing so I could replace the air intake tube, I somehow managed to get the grommet / rubber seat that is normally attached to the housing onto the \"peg\" (where the air filter is supposed to sit). Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/Y6Le3lt3E3w?t=261) (by someone else) of what I mean by the \"grommet\" or \"rubber seat.\" If it doesn't already, it is described at around 4:21. Basically, that \"rubber seat\" is no longer on the housing; where the \"rubber seat\" is, is now just a plastic ring. The \"rubber seat\" is stuck on the place where the air filter housing is supposed to sit. **As a result, I've had no luck in trying to get the** ***whole*** **air filter housing back on the place where it's supposed to sit.** Emphasis on whole -- if I take the lid off the air filter housing, then I can move the bottom part of the housing around in different angles until I force it onto the place where it's supposed to sit. But, when the lid is on, it becomes a lot harder for me. Also, with the way the car is designed, the whole housing needs to be put into the right spot -- you cannot put the bottom part of the housing in, and then put the lid of the housing in afterwards. I was able to put the two 10mm bolts back on the air filter housing, which I believe bolts them into the car (see around 1:44 in the aforementioned video for what I mean). Additionally, the air filter housing still feels almost like as if I didn't take it out originally; that is to say, it *feels* secure. I also did a test drive (30 miles, consisting of a mix of highway and city driving) after replacing the air intake tube, and the main issues I had with the car are no longer there, which is what I was hoping to get out of this. I do hear some rattling when driving, but I believe that is from the splash shield not being installed correctly. I don't think there's any sounds coming from the air filter housing. I guess my question is: **should I still try to get the air filter housing back on where it's supposed to sit, or will it be fine to leave it alone?** I also plan on going to the mechanic tomorrow to ask them this same question, but I figure I might as well ask here in case someone might experience with this. Let me know if you need any clarification, and I appreciate any advice! The car is a 2012 Honda Civic LX (4 cylinder, 1.8L).",

I took my car to a “tire” place in January who upsold me on front brakes and an alignment, since then it’s been making a clunking/clacking noise when hitting any bumps. Yes, I’ve taken it back and they said they didn’t hear anything. I then took it somewhere else so replaced the tie rod ends and struts. After a day or two the noise came back. I then took it to a VW dealership that said they couldn’t find anything aside from something loose and tightened it. The noise stopped after a few days and came back. Finally, I took it to another VW dealership who drove it for 3 hours, and claimed their tech and a master tech could not find the problem. They charged me $400 to tell me this. In all, I’m out about $3k on this nightmare. Would any of you guys be able to help me find where to at least look for this?",

Car: 2019 Mercedes A-Class A220 Mileage: ~90,000 km Here are the symptoms: • The ticking sound mainly occurs when the engine is cold. • Sometimes it’s fairly quiet, but other times it’s noticeably louder—especially after 1–2 minutes of driving. • Once the engine is fully warmed up, the ticking either fades significantly or disappears entirely. • I’ve already replaced the engine belt and the alternator pulley, but the sound continues. • It seems more pronounced at low speeds and during light acceleration. If anyone has had a similar experience or can help identify the possible cause, I’d really appreciate your input. Thanks in advance!",

Theres almost nothing left from the heat shield thats near the exhaust manifold (see 1st pic). Should i change it, or maybe it doesnt matter? 2. Flexible connection (pic 2) is starting to have a gap between it and the exhaust pipe. Is it minor or major issue? 3. And finally the weld between exhaust pipe and the muffler (pic 3 and 4) is done. I can see that somebody tried (very poorly) to weld it in the past. And now the weld a couple of inches/milimeters away from it burned. Is it logical to cut off that poorly welded part of the exhaust pipe, and weld (more accurately) new piece of pipe? 4. As I understand, if I fix these places, then after some time holes will form in new (weakest) places. For example somewhere in the middle of the car. Would it be better to just buy whole new exhaust system? Adding the pics: https://imgur.com/a/IEY66iB Thanks for any help.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I own a 2023 Cupra Ateca that I recently had armoured for security reasons. The package included 23mm ballistic glass, ballistic steel and polyurethane filling, which added approximately 350kg to the car's weight. Since the armouring, the suspension feels far too soft and unstable — the car leans heavily in corners and feels floaty at speed. The company who did the armouring says they can “adjust” the suspension, but I’m looking for a proper, long-term solution. I’m particularly interested in upgrading to something like Bilstein, but I’m open to suggestions (KW, Koni, Eibach, etc.). My goal is to restore firmness and stability without making the ride unbearably harsh. Has anyone reinforced their suspension after armouring a vehicle like this? Appreciate any advice or shared experiences!",

Adding weight to the windows and doors typically makes a car more top heavy. You can buy a typically valved shock body and have it revalved for your needs. Getting a spring will require you reaching out to someone like H&R, Eibach or Swift to have a custom spring made. Either way, the car will handle worse than stock. It’ll roll more either way. Get smaller wheels with tires that don’t larger side walls to allow for a more compliant ride.",

This isn’t my first armoured vehicle, but it’s the first time the suspension has felt truly off. I’m not a politician and I’m definitely not involved in anything shady. I run a plastics-processing company here in Mexico and, while Mexico is a great country, some areas where my clients are located can be rough. I often have to visit factories or offices in industrial neighbourhoods that aren’t exactly the safest spots, so the extra protection is just a practical precaution. Being a tall, white, blond guy doesn’t help either—people tend to assume you’re a millionaire just by looking at you. The armour keeps things low-stress when I’m out on the road. Your suggestion about custom-valved shocks and bespoke springs makes total sense. I’ll start talking to Bilstein (or maybe KW) and see about getting the dampers re-valved and proper springs made by H&R, Eibach or Swift. I’ll also look into downsizing the wheels to get taller sidewalls for a bit more compliance. Really appreciate you taking the time to spell it all out—cheers!",

I was installing things back and putting the bolt on the right side of the wiring harness for the spark plugs, and dropped the dang bolt on the right side the secures it in place-behind/to the right of the gasket. I tried use my phone and lights and what not last night to find it but wasn't able to do so. I'm checking again today. Nonetheless, Im wondering....is that liable to cause any problems? Thankfully I didnt drop it into the engine (without the gasket cover) or something terrible. I just dont wanna start this car and then something go wonky or some Final Destination type crap happen and my car goes kaput. Can anyone give feedback here? **TLDR**: Was working on my 2012 civic hybrid to replace the vale gasket cover and accidentally dropped the securing bolt of the right side of the wiring harness for the spark plugs, behind/to the back right the gasket cover. Is this liable to cause any issues in my engine (when I start my car) if I cant find it?",

Every time I have the air on it blows parts of the carcass into the back seat. Gross I know. It is too large to reach through the vent with tweezers or pliers to remove. I think I need to remove the vent and take it apart to remove the dead cockroach. Any ideas how to do this? There are no YouTube videos I can find that show how to remove the vent in the backseat.",

The car however still \"seems\" to work just fine, as in braking works normally, the parking brake, e brake, and brake hold all work like normal. What could be causing the issue? Some background info: this started happening today. No incidents has happened recently. However I will admit the car has been needing an alignment check/correction (car slightly drifts to the right) for quiet some time now, roughly about a year that I been neglecting to do. Maybe that's the correlation? Probably also important to note that about 3 years ago the right driver wheel lost a stud and I been driving on 4/5 studs (however wheel is stable and not loose) I'm admitting fault and it could have been preventable however I would like to know what's going on, how bad is it and is it drivable until I can go to a mechanic this Monday?",

Also sometimes when you start the car you have to pump or hold the gas for a couple of seconds to hold the idle, but it still idles low. My mechanic discovered that within the space where the idle air control valve sits and connects to the throttle body there is some coolant seeping in. He thinks that the section of the gasket that sits between the coolant chamber and idle air control valve chamber has failed and is allowing coolant to get sucked into the idle air control valve chamber causing the low idle and stalling issue. Finding a replacement gasket is hard and almost impossible because of how old this car is. What he did is a coolant bypass so coolant is now rerouted and not going into the throttle body anymore and is just flowing back to where it came from. He told me that after doing this the car ran fine and idle was stable. He also told me that coolant does not need to flow into the throttle body especially because I live in Southern California which is a warm climate so this could be a permanent fix and I don't think the gasket needs to be replaced either because coolant wasn't leaking outwards, but instead it was seeping from one chamber to another. **I'm usually a skeptical and paranoid person so I just wanted to know if any mechanics can confirm to me that this was the issue all along. If coolant gets into the idle air control valve chamber and then the pintle on the idle air control valve opens to allow air in and instead coolant is sucked in as well can that cause low idle rpm and stalling?** The throttle body was cleaned 1 1/2 years ago and the idle air control valve is a brand new OEM version that is only 1 1/2 half years old too. The current mechanic also cleaned the MAF sensor and tried to start the car and it wouldn't. This was before he discovered the leak.",

We signed a contract stating we would only allow THEIR APPROVED mechanics to work on it. About a month ago my vehicle started making a really hard jerking sound and vibration. I had my uncle who is a mechanic LOOK at my vehicle just to see what may be the issue to give me an estimate on how much it might cost to fix it and found out that whoever owned the vehicle in the past whether it was the car company or previous SPRAY FOAMED a frame and painted it black to make it look like a metal frame. So I have been driving this car a little over a year with my disabled parents and disabled son without knowing I was in a literal death trap. I want to give the car back and just be done with it but the company is telling me I will owe whatever it costs to fix the car before I can return it. Mind you all, I originally came in there wanting a 2014 Chevy Equinox but they said they couldn't give me that car but had the 2013 Chevy Equinox that they could in fact lease to me. I honestly feel like I was set up. I just need to know if I have case or not, and if so what type of attorney do I need to contact regarding this issue. Only asking for advice please keep all negativity to yourself. I need help and I would appreciate only advice instead of judgment or negativity. Thank you",

Im assuming thats what you mean by lease since leases are only for brand new. And you signed a contract that specifies you use their mechanics? Im also going to assume that means they provided you with a vehicle service contract (commonly called an extended warranty). If it is one they provide in-house on all their cars it can specify that it only covers the cost of repairs at their shop, and that repairs you have done elsewhere would not be covered. This is pretty common when a dealership provides these for free on their cars. Before you purchased the car, who did you take it to in order to have a pre-purchase inspection done? Did they note the frame issue? The service contract the dealership provided you with at time of purchase.. what does it cover? Is it mechanical only? Is it bumper to bumper? How many years and miles? You should black out your personal information and post it. It's been two years, not two weeks, so you're likely on your own. However if they do have a rust/corrosion warranty in there you could have some coverage. You'll also have what's called a buyers guide. It says what the warranty is and whether the car was sold as-is.",

I'd pick up some dielectric grease at the auto store. You can usually get a little packet as it goes a long way. You might want to grab a cheap battery terminal cleaning tool as well. I think they're a few dollars. Also, check the positive side as well. Probably wouldn't hurt to clean and grease that side, too, skipping the baking soda mess if there's no visible corrosion.

Bluetooth and phone call works fine, just the touchscreen stopped working. I'd prefer to DIY the replacement rather than pay over $1,100 to an audio shop to install an aftermarket one. One thing I looked at was possibly buying the same radio on ebay: [https://www.ebay.com/itm/164225640198](https://www.ebay.com/itm/164225640198) . However, I read that sometimes there are VIN locks, issues with programming with the steering wheel, and other problems (e.g. ebay motors not being great for parts), so now I'm worried. It looks legit and easy to plug in, but I want to make sure. Can I buy the radio replacement via ebay, and will it work as easy as plug and play? Or are there issues such that I should look at aftermarket radios (e.g. Crutchfield) if I want to DIY it? https://preview.redd.it/2pc2148tjjze1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11b35bc190d7cd35a235b094cbd6133523f754e3",

When it switches from dim to full bright, that's when it starts hyperflashing. As far as I can tell, the explorer doesn't use a flasher relay but just reads resistance and the BCM changes the timing as an \"error code\".

The upgrade includes 23mm ballistic glass, ballistic steel panels, and polyurethane filling—overall it added about 350 kg to the car’s weight. While the protection is great, the suspension didn’t hold up well after the armor was installed. It now feels too soft, unstable, and bouncy, especially at speed or when turning. The shop that did the armoring says they can “adjust” it, but I’m not fully confident they know the best suspension solution for this kind of setup. Does anyone have experience or solid recommendations for upgrading suspension on a vehicle with added weight like this? I’ve heard of brands like Bilstein, KW, Koni, and Ohlins—would any of these work well with a 350kg weight increase? I want something that restores stability and handling without making the ride overly harsh. Thanks in advance for any help or shared experiences.",

On the fifth try or so it stopped and I was able to drive off. I took it in to get an oil change and my transmission fluid replaced the next day and the sound stopped for a month. (My oil was severely low even though I wasn't due for another 1000 miles) Flash forward to this week, it happened again. I took it to an auto shop and they couldn't recreate it or pin down the issue. While I was there I got my front ujoint replaced and a leak on my transfer case fixed. I've also routinely checked my oil levels and they look good. I thought that may have fixed it but the sound has come back. Btw, I pretty much only ever drive in 2wd mode. Tldr: Weird growling sound and shaking happens out of the blue sometimes when I drive at low speeds. This continues to happen every time I turn on the car until eventually it stops and I am gtg.",

Cover the alternator and distributor perhaps? Or just blow it out if any moisture gets in? They could at least have cleaned the engine bay around the engine... \\- A small oil spill on the trunk mat was completely ignored. It's in the grooves and would need a bit of work, but still. \\- Various dirt left on on the interior. Door pockets, trunk area, \\- I paid extra to have the seats cleaned. They didn't bother reclining the seats so they missed a lot of dirt. \\- They treated most of the faded plastic, but didn't bother with the driver side mirror. \\- Side windows were obviously cleaned while closed, so they are still dirty on top.

Should have been addressed when they did the contact wash. Cover the electric stuff and move on. Oil, fail on them. The rest kinda lands on a few things. 1. We are always cautious working on old surfaces. There is a fine line between cleaned and detailed. Some materials will not come all the way back. So we clean them and simply dress the surfaces lightly. 2. Glass is always tricky. Was polishing the glass part of the conversation with the detailer? At the end of the day ALWAYS have a conversation about what the expected/agreed upon finished product will look like. Under promise and over deliver. I do a full vehicle walk through with client and discuss all areas of the vehicle and what to expect. I make notes on my walk around sheet and we both sign off on it.

Too many cases where the car won’t start or a check engine light comes on and then they have to pay to repair it. Now they either don’t do it or make you sign a waiver saying it’s at your own risk. Finally, it’s always amusing how people bring a 30 year old car that’s never been cared for and expect it to come out looking like new. They can’t work miracles.

But assuming the areas you pointed out here were discussed then they should have been addressed… The engine bay could have been wiped down by hand. But again if you did not ask for the engine bay to be detailed it would be ignored. The mirror… it’s trashed. Get a new one… I mean seriously, what did you expect from that.

A while back the engine sometimes got stuck at very high rpms for idle, around 3-4k and wouldnt go away unless restarting the engine a few times. I changed the idle control valve and the throttle sensor and the problem went away. Last week I started misfiring which I diagnosed to be the ignition coil so I swapped that, spark plugs and the wires. Problem went away. Now my problem is that the car does all these things again, plus makes a really awful noise (see video). I honestly have no clue what this could be. Any ideas?

My mechanic believes just the clutch is going, as the other compressor belts are still working. His advice is **just** to get a denso compressor and he will do the replacement. While searching for parts I found a kit for about 40$ more that comes with an expansion valve and drier replacement. I assume this would probably add more cost in labor to replace those, but I don't know how much. Just replacing the compressor, my mechanic would still have to open and flush the system, right? So in my head, might as well fix those parts while it's open. **Here's the tricky part** while my current compressor hasn't catastrophically failed, this is my second compressor. Previous owner replaced the compressor in 2018 with one from a junk yard, didn't change any other parts in the AC system. I have no idea if there are metal shavings in the system that are maybe all hanging out in the condenser. My mechanic doesn't think I need it, but it's only 80 dollars for a new denso condenser. For peace of mind should I insist on replacing both? And either way, 15 years of New England wear and tear on the condenser can't be nothing. Again, more labor costs I'm sure, but I don't know how much that changes the job.",

    "selftext": "About a year ago, I was driving about 70mph on the freeway on cruise control. I feel the car start to lose momentum and look down to see I’m losing speed. I press the gas to speed up and nothing happens. I pulled over and came to a stop. I press the gas again and it starts to move somewhat normally; however, when I press the gas harder than the car wants, it starts to sputter. So I basically get it home driving 30-40mph making sure I press the gas very lightly. Took it to a shop… $3500 later I have a list of things that they fixed that went wrong. Whatever.. I don’t know anything about cars so just needed it fixed. Didn’t think twice about it. Ran fine until last week. Same exact issue. Heading to work on cruise control when the car starts slowing down. Give it gas - same exact thing. Drive home going 30-40. At 40 it seems to start sputtering the same way it does when I press the gas ‘too hard’. I pull out my packet from when it was fixed last year and see that I have a warranty. Call them up and they say take it to this shop. I do that yesterday. Guy calls me back saying bad news… engine is toast. Something about a gasket needing to be replaced and that a new engine would probably be around the same price. Recommended I start car shopping. Talk to a friend about it and they are confused as to why the engine would need to be replaced if I can still drive the vehicle somewhat normally up until 40MPH. I am completely ignorant when it comes to cars so I have no idea what it could be. I also find it weird that it starts fine and can drive pretty decent if I’m pressing the gas lightly if the engine is completely shot. Do any of you have any idea what could be happening? Would you recommend I try to find another shop to diagnose it? What’s an acceptable diagnostics fee these days? I appreciate your help!",

That being said, I am NOT an attorney, and this is not specific legal advice as I am not legally qualified to give that. Just some general things to do if you are in a situation like this. I've also had a couple of family members over the years that have had similar issues. One who didn't read the contract, and the other where fraud was committed. Also, I don't live in Texas, but I did spend a couple of minutes looking up their title fraud laws (I live in Iowa, we have similar laws). So here it goes... Okay, time to pull out that paperwork you signed at the dealership. Does it say on the paperwork ANYWHERE that the vehicle has a salvage title, prior salvage, or rebuilt.? If so, you probably don't have much in the way of legal options. Now, IF the dealer sold you a vehicle without disclosing that it had a salvage, rebuilt, etc title, you do have some options. IF this is the case, the dealership in question may have committed dealer fraud under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). I say IF, because many times when things like this occur, the purchaser did not read the paperwork thoroughly before signing (which is a tactic shitty dealers use on purpose. They wear you down in the financial office and most people just want to sign so they can get out of there). If it appears that this is fraud, here's what you do: 1. Gather all documentation. (Basically, if it isn't in writing, in most states, you have no standing). 2. Contact the dealership. State that the vehicle was sold without disclosing the issues, and that you would like a full refund. If they are unwilling to do that, you are going to report them to the Texas DMV. Make sure to act professionally, and in writing as well as verbally. If it isn't in writing, it didn't happen. Remember that. 3. When the dealership refuses (they probably will, because if they are as shitty as you say, they knowing fucked you over), report them to the Texas DMV. Provide the person handling your case with all of your documentation. Make sure all communication with the dealership is in writing. Even better, record your phone calls (Texas is a one-party recording state, so this is completely legal to do without their consent or notification). Have all of this ready when reporting. 4. Be prepared to file a complaint with the Texas Attorney general and also consider seeking legal counsel. If you have evidence that fraud has been committed, and the dealership is found liable, they will likely be responsible for making you whole (most likely, refunding the price of the vehicle) and pay any court and attorney fees. You need to be prepared for a fight. This is going to be a long process. But IF fraud was committed, and you have documentation to prove it, you will likely get some relief. Also, your statute of limitations is 24 months from the time of purchase, so you'd better get on this quick. Also, I would cross post this in /legaladvice. That's where lawyers hang out. And the questions aren't answered by average joes. But by attorneys. You get banned real fast from that subreddit if you are someone like me who is not a licensed attorney and try to answer legal questions. I'm glad they do that because there is a big difference in \"knowing some things\" and being a practicing attorney that works daily on shit like this.",

I took it into the shop recently due to the engine being a bit louder, the previous mechanic mentioned the fuel tank was stained, and the check engine light came on, so I wanted to get it fully checked out. The damage was: 1. The fuel tank was rotted pretty bad and needed to be replaced, quoted $1000 to fix it 2. The high and low power steering lines were \"leaking\" (i've had no power steering issues and a mechanic buddy came by and had a brief look and said that they really didn't look that bad) and very crusty. Quoted $800 for it. 3. The knock sensor is what tripped the check engine light, quoted $250 to fix that. 4. The noise from my engine was the exhaust. Two flanges are fairly bad and should be replaced soon, the third flange is very bad and should be replaced. $600. After taxes and labour and all that, apparently looking around 3k in total, which the car probably isn't worth much more than that to be honest. I originally decided I'd probably just junk it / sell as is and figure out something else. Curious for this subs thoughts on it? Thanks!",

    "selftext": "I'm an armchair car enthusiast, and I'm wondering if my case is unique or not. I had this enthusiasm for cars since childhood, going from toys and collecting car figures to reading and watching everything about specific car models online, on YouTube, Reddit, etc. There's just literally so much stuff I've read and watched about cars, it's hard to describe. But the thing is that I'm a young guy, and I've never had a car ever. I also don't have a stable high-income job, but I have been freelancing and sort of digital nomading for a while. I'm working on building a stable high-income career right now though. And unlike many youngsters today, I'd love to have my own car somewhere someday. I'd love to have the freedom to drive anywhere I want in my own private vehicle at any moment. I've been fantasizing about that for a while. And while choosing which car I'd like to own as my first or my main and only car, I've faced this strange paradox. In the beginning, I've been thinking how I'd love to own some old Merc (W123, W124, W201) or old BMW (E30), and I thought that I'd love repairing them DIY, because I'm somewhat mechanically inclined. But then I realized that with all the stuff in my life, all the hobbies and activities... I've realized that while I have some real passion for cars, I love to read and watch everything about them, actually going and fixing an old car, or any car whatsoever, spending days and hours of my life on that - is the last thing I'd ever want to do. There are two reasons for that: 1. I'm kind of lazy 2. There's always so much stuff in real life that is worth your attention, whether it's watching a movie, reading a book, spending time with your family, improvising some melody while playing guitar/piano, or learning something new about coding/programming. There's just never enough time for everything. I'm also not the person who likes to change things often. I'm thinking I'm that type of person who'd love to own and drive the same car for 10-20 years. So I've realized that some Toyota Corolla E120 (9th gen) would be a perfect car for me. I literally need a car-cockroach that will run forever with regular maintenance, and it's not going to break too often, and it's not going to be too expensive.",

Nope, it’s not that. My concern is that if I were to buy some older German car, like Merc or BMW, moving forward the next 5-10 or more years, it would take a lot of time working on it DIY. The older they get = the more things to break. And it’s not like I wouldn’t want to spend this time working on the car. But that would mean I have to manage my time differently. That would mean I’d spend less time on other things, whether it’s sleeping, resting, watching a movie, spending time with family, writing music, or learning programming, anything. And from that point of view, it makes sense to choose the car that would take the least of my time repairing it, meaning owning the most reliable car, like a Corolla/Camry or Honda Civic/Accord. I think it’s kind of amazing on its own that there are tons of 20+ years old Corollas on the roads, and in the next 20-30 years, there still will be plenty of them on the roads. I think at the moment people don’t really understand the value of it. That’s why E120 Corollas got my attention, because they’re somewhat still modern, reliable as hell, and mechanically simple. Keeping one on the road for another 10-15 years seems like a great deal for me.",

The clicking sound is the relay clicking over and over as the coils energize and die. Relay is an electromechanical device so it will only engage so many times. Can happen. If one cell in your battery dies overnight. I bet your battery is at 10v. You will likely need to jump it every time. One should always own a multimeter. I'll bet it reads 10v with no load. A regular low battery will usually engage the relay and even pull the starter gear in place. But once it starts drawing real current (starter motor) it just goes real slow.",

    "selftext": "This issue has only happened during the first engine start of the day. When I start the car, the glow plug warning light begins blinking, not staying on constantly but actually flashing. During this period, I also notice a loss of engine power. After about 10 to 15 minutes, the glow plug light turns off and the check engine light appears. Interestingly, after driving for a while, even the check engine light goes away on its own. The error code I get is P2564, which relates to the turbocharger boost control position sensor. I took the car to a turbocharger specialist who had a quick look and said the turbo itself is probably not the issue. Another workshop, however, claimed that the turbo needs to be replaced. From what I’ve read in various forums, I’m leaning toward it being an issue with the wiring or the sensor itself. Many people mentioned that the fault persisted even after replacing the turbocharger, which makes me think the problem lies elsewhere. Also, whenever the glow plug light is not blinking, the car performs with full power. The issue started when the weather got colder, and I never experienced it during warmer conditions. That’s another reason why I suspect it could be a wiring or sensor issue affected by temperature.",

Common issues are purge valves located under the plastic engine cover. This vehicle however had a different problem. After performing a smoke test on the evap system (.020 size leak) I found the leak on top of the fuel tank (right side rear) coming from a molded port on the fuel tank. The port is cracked all the way through. The proper way to fix this is to replace the fuel tank. So if you're running into this issue with a P0456 on your mustang this may be the cause. I got the fuel tank today and the tank strap bolts (TP50) need to be heated up with an inductive heater to soften the loctite or good luck getting them out. Hope this helps if you're mustang has this issue.",

    "selftext": "So I received my dads old 1968 Jeepster Commadno as a project car, its been sitting for more than 20 years at this point. Did a lot of work and finally got the engine to run and stay running! kind of. The issue is the carb is not getting enough gas. I replaced the rubber fuel line parts but the majority of the fuel lines are steel. They are insanely clogged and im not sure exactly how to unclog them at this point im thinking a long ass pipe cleaner or something i could find on amazon. I dont want to use fuel additives just because I dont think they would actually help unclog it since its so gunked up and barely any fuel is getting to the carb. Any advise or tips. Dont really want to re-do the steel lines but I will if I have to. (I should note thatt yes I have replaced the mechanical fuel pump , fuel filter, and other fuel parts its just this damn clog.)",

You have to hold or tap on the gas to keep the rpm up and eventually it will hold, but still at a low idle speed. I had this same issue a year and a half ago and another mechanic replace the idle air control valve with an OEM version and also cleaned the throttle body. The car ran okay for a year and a half and the stalling issues came back. My current mechanic which is different then the previous one told me that he removed the throttle body and disconnected the idle air control valve from it and discovered that coolant was leaking into the space where the idle air control valve attaches to the throttle body. He showed me pictures of drops of green fluid in the space. If coolant was getting into the space between the IACV and throttle body could that be causing my low idling and stalling issue?

I have a 2007 Ford ranger with the 4.0 and this morning it stalled out and since then it has been in limp mode.. the stall happened right after a cold start and consisted of some pretty intense shaking and then engine stopped and oil, engine, and battery light came on. Since then it has been in limp mode. I decided to change the oil even though it’s only been about 2,000 miles since the last oil change. The oil was in acceptable range. My coolant however was suspiciously low. Filled it up. Ended up needing a new battery so I got that. And now I’m here. I’ve checked all of my fuses, replace one unimportant one that happened to be bad, I’ve meticulously looked through wiring, hoses, MAS airflow sense, checked transmission oil. The weird thing is the engine isn’t sending any codes, I confirmed this with two of my readers and a local shop’s reader. At this point I have no clue where to look other than replacing random things until it fixes the issue. I do worry I may need a new ECU all together. Any thoughts on where to go from here??

But you can either use the adaptive cruise when traffic slows down and accept the “me first” behavior of everyone on the road, or you can turn it off and join them in playing the game of “I don’t follow too close, I’m just not leaving space for a car to fit in front of me”",

My mechanic was able to reroute the coolant using a bypass method away from the throttle body so coolant doesn't flow through the throttle body anymore and leak into it causing the issues. He said the car has been driving fine since he did this. My question is there any long term damage that can be done doing this and is there any long term damage in not fixing the gasket issue if coolant is not flowing into it?

I didn’t go fast at all (50 km/h or 30 mph) but suddenly the roll-bar popped up while the roof was down, I know this is a safety feature but it didn’t want to go down anymore. I drove home and decided to open the roof and hope that, that would trigger the system into thinking that the roll-bar could be closed. As you guessed it, it didn’t work. Matter fact it got worse. I tried to close the roof and everything closed except for the trunk. It was still up and wouldn’t go down anymore. I don’t know what to do now. I’ve tried various solutions such as holding the roll-bar up button (saw this solution to stop the emergency system), I tried pressing down the pins in the roll-bar spring system, disconnected the hydrologic oil, checked the fuses and I tried to reopen the roof with the key (holding the close button for 15 seconds to either open the roof or take out the hydrologic system. Now the trunk could be lowered but not closed due to the interior trims not being retracted). Now I’m stuck with a trunk thats open for about 15cm, a stuck roll-bar and a roof that doesn’t respond. Ps. there is enough hydrologic oil in the tank, because I recently refilled it. Not like I can fill it up now tho, but it’s worth mentioning. Anyone who’s got a tip, solution or anything that would help? Thanks. Kind regards this SL350 owner",

Correct me if I’m wrong, but from what I’ve been researching, it’s illegal to put LED bulbs into a headlight assembly that was originally designed for halogen bulbs. If that’s the case, would replacing the entire headlight assembly with an aftermarket LED assembly be a proper and legal way to upgrade to LEDs? And if so, what are the pros, cons, and general opinions on doing this? Thanks in advance!",

Yes, it is possible to retrofit the headlight assemblies to add proper optics for an LED light source/driver. There's a whole cottage industry around doing proper LED retrofits (as opposed to drop-ins, which as you've already been told, are terrible, and in some jurisdictions, illegal). But honestly? It's still a waste of time. Modern cars have adequate headlights. The brightness war has not made night driving safer. Focus your energy on learning to take on your own maintenance, which will save you a lot of money and give you more pride in ownership than brighter lights. If you think, nah it already runs fine... there's always more maintenance to do. How old is the DSG fluid? The brake fluid? Have you greased the door pins? If you're desperate to just do cosmetic stuff to make it look better, then learn how to properly detail it. An older car with glossy paint and clean wheels stands out.",

Here’s the list of things that’s been done: Replaced drum brake shoes (due to uneven wear) Bleed brakes manually via bleeder screws Bleed brakes via scantool and ABS Replaced brake master cylinder Replaced brake fluid Replaced brake booster vacuum hose Other things that has been checked: Rotors and brake pads are good Calipers are not stuck No sign of external leaks No fault codes No leaks in wheel cylinder Other things that have been noticed in the brakes: -Rusty brake dust on the drums -Weird sound when the brake pedal is pushed when the car is idle (it’s like a squeaky sound when the shoes are making contact with the drum) - this one came off after the parking brake was adjusted I’ve already asked local shops and have it checked multiple times but they can’t pinpoint the exact problem. Majority says it was a bad master cylinder so I had it replaced but it didn’t fixed my problem. Now, someone adviced me to replace my wheel cylinders because there’s a weird noise coming from both sides of the rear brakes when the pedal is pushed when the car is idle but there are no leaks coming from the cylinders. Someone also said that it could be a bad booster, however, the pedal is not hard and the symptom is quite the opposite for a bad booster. My brakes are not completely lost and I can still drive my car but with extra care and I need to do extra pumps to get a full stop. I wanna get it fixed really bad so any help would be much appreciated. 😭",

        "body": "Just throwing in my 2c here. Spongy brakes can be multiple symptoms, and considering a vast majority of the actual braking force is handled via the front, I would actually shift focus on that end rather than possibly chase the rear drums. Wouldn't hurt to actually do a proper inspection of the front rotors themselves to ensure they haven't glazed over, thus severely harming the rotors effectiveness. I would also check the front pads themselves while you're at it to ensure you haven't actually overcooked those either. Considering you described that you need to get extra pumps and that it isn't a hard pedal but a decisively soft one, I would also recommend doing a proper drain and fill of the brake fluid entirely rather than a simple corner bleed, ideally with something like a power bleeder. Finally, 2011 vehicle means that age is definitely a real concern, and you could also have a very real possibility of your brake lines themselves are shot internally and are flexing/deforming. --- I do want to also state that I am not a mechanic, just somebody who DIY's their own shit and runs their car hard, so I'm thinking of the typical performance side of spongy (soft) brake pedal. Even for a performance car, once you glaze over the rotors or cook the brake fluid, the pedal is going to feel like shit even with stainless lines. Factor in that something like your Hyundai will have vastly smaller rotors with a more economy focused brake pad, and even a few aggressive 70-20 stops back2back2back can risk glazing them over.",

    "selftext": "A few years ago I bought a '18 Camaro 1SS 1LE. I loved the car, the noise, speed, acceleration, how it looked and drove. A year ago I traded the car in because i moved to a colder climate that has snow and ice and also wanted something more practical. So I found myself in Golf R. Don't get me wrong, this car is Fun! Extremely practical, fun easy to drive and move around and can SEE out of it. Now I'm moving back to a warm climate again and as fun as the R is, it's not the same as the SS was. The sneeze whiz bang pops for the Ea888, is nothing vs the Vulgar Yelling and manual gear switching of the LT1 V8 from the SS 1LE. Thing is I found a duplicate of my old 1LE and it's bit me to want to go get it. The reason for this post, is I have a car bucket list and a few of those cars are also available. Like an Ram SRT10, Terminator, Mustang, New Pontiac GTO, CTS-V1. With the Camaro I fell like I didn't do all the things I wanted to wich was track it a few times like I had planned.

Also, possibly unrelated, for years my car has made this sort of gurgling/hissing noise like steam/pressure or something building up and then releasing before it builds up again and then releases on repeat. I've pointed this out to mechanics and they've always either told me it's nothing or that they didn't hear anything (it doesn't happen all the time). Any help?",

I'm looking at $400 for the best non-power coat solution, which I'm told will only last for a few years. I'm considering just spraying some Dupli-Color myself. My first question is, if I do it myself, do I absolutely have to sand blast them first, or can I just spray it on top? Secondly, how long before it chips and becomes visible ugly again. Would applying some ceramic coating on top of the Dupli-Color make it last significantly longer? Any advice and other considerations are greatly appreciated.",

The remote key fob also doesn’t lock the car anymore. I assumed the battery was drained, so I tried jump-starting it, but that didn’t help at all. Still the same clicking and no response from the central locking. Any ideas what could be going on? Could it be something beyond the battery—like a fuse, starter motor?

    "selftext": "#Edit: Code is P0301, I'm a dummy. For background the battery in my girlfriends 2016 CRV died in October. She replaced it with a non oem battery. A couple of months ago she woke up and the check engine, power steering, tire pressure, and traction control lights were on additionally she noticed that cylinder 1 was misfiring. She consulted with a friend of hers and decided to replace the coil packs. On the way to Auto Zone she noticed that the lights had gone out, but the cylinder was still misfiring. She replaced the coil packs and nothing changed. About a month later she took the car to her dad, and he realized that when they installed the replacement battery they did so with the bracket touching the battery terminal. He ratcheted back the bracket, and instantly the misfiring stopped. A few days later she started the car in the morning and the cylinder was misfiring again, as well as the 3 error lights coming back on. At this point she replaced the battery again, this time with an oem one, and once again the cylinder stopped misfiring, and the error codes disappeared. A few days later the same issues started happening again. The she tried disconnecting and reseating the battery, which once again cleared the issue, only for it to start happening again a few days later. Today she disconnected the battery and reconnected it, and the issue disappeared again, but for obvious reasons we suspect it will come back in the next few days. Things she has tried: Replaced battery (twice), coil packs, spark plugs. She has had two scans run and the only error being thrown is cylinder 1 misfire. Electrical diagnostic at auto zone showed no error with battery or alternator. She is now being advised to treat it as a cylinder issue, not as an electrical system issue. This doesn't really jive with things that I've read, but I'm obviously not the expert, so I'm 100% willing to be wrong here.j I'm not much of a car guy, so if I relayed any of this information in a way that doesn't make sense please let me know, but she's really pulling her hair out over this, any help would be appreciated.",

Driving on the highway, battery saver mode came on and the battery was draining big time. Managed to get it to a garage. They said it would be a new alternator. Fine. Collected it later that week. Literally a week later the EXACT same thing happened, only this time closer to home. Took it to a garage I trust and they’ve told me I got screwed by the other garage (who fitted the alternator) as they’d put one in that wasn’t powerful enough for the beastly Traverse. So the garage I trust is putting in a new one - but what on earth do I do about the $1100+ I’ve shelled out for a part that a) wasn’t fit for purpose and b) didn’t last a week!? EDIT - For those asking, the invoice states it was a Duralast Alternator DL5602-6-1, which Autozone recommends. But that is at a disconnect with what the new garage is stating. Intent is to request my money back from the garage who did the fitting. If not, small claims court could be in my future!",

Fortunately I was not far from my usual garage and managed to limp it there so there's no tow truck involved. I paid to have it inspected and they found the new alternator has no output but interestingly they believe it's undersized alternator? Too small for this application? I'm not sure. It's entirely possible you were sent the wrong alternator but it physically fit and the tech just went ahead and installed it because it was working. I've already had the vehicle repaired at my cost again so I'm need to get the invoice refunded and get this now-inoperable alternator back to you. I'll also include a copy of my invoice from here so you can make a claim against your part supplier for the labor that's lost, if you need it.\" It'd be nice to add the lines \"Your guys did fine, there were no lose bolts or installation errors - it's just the wrong alternator and it shit the bed.\"",

I offered to do a full repair free of charge. Judge sided with me. Customer had to pay all court costs because I offered to do so from the get go. It wasn’t my responsibility to transport the vehicle from another state because a customer moved. We correctly installed a remanufactured transmission from a nationwide company. It wasn’t my shops fault either and we were going to have to eat all the labor to redo the job under warranty. We ended up shipping a new remanufactured transmission to the shop in their state. Something I had no legal obligation to do. If they offered to do the repair and you refuse to bring the vehicle to them I’m afraid you have no leg to stand on.",

I had similar issue, when it could lock, but only when key is in 0 position (it still must not lock the wheel until keys sre ibside). Try to reproduse yhe issue without moving, just on the idle. The best way to fix it is a lock replacement. Contacts can be reviewed and cleaned/fixed most probably. But it also may be caues by two issues at the same time. First issue may be related to the fuel system. Try to analyze - how much fuel is in the tank? I heard about such issue on some cars made for US (or not only for US), when on the right turn engine stalled because fuel pump got air, there were not much fuel in the tank and on the turn it moved left. Theoretically it also may be caused by moving parts during the turn. Something may press on the fuel hose somewhere u der the hood and it causes engine stall. Chances are low, but should be checked easily. And steering wheel issue still caused by ignition lock.",

It can be hard to hear while driving on faster roads, but on slow roads or if I’m holding on my brakes in a drive-thru, it’s just extremely loud and the noise only dies down when the car is in Parked. Most of the noise seems to be coming from the front half of the car rather than the back half, and I’ve also noticed that very rarely when I take turns, my car will suddenly have a quick kick to it, like a slight boost. Not sure if that’s normal or if I’m taking turnings too quickly somehow, that’s less of my concern but just something else I noticed that very rarely happens, but the noise is very much consistent the entire time my car is driving now. Any help would be appreciated, sorry for the dark video, just got off work, but what I was doing was going from Parked and between Drive and Reverse, each time the noise died down, it was me going back to the Parked position.",

        "body": "Okay, I saw the other post the other day. My mom also drove an 06 Corolla that she bought new, until about last week. Her commute since I was 11 years old in 06 was 45 minutes/54 miles one way, 108 miles a day. A total of 580k miles just for work since she bought it. She hit the odometer limit of 299999 when I was in highschool, in 2012. She kept loose track of her mileage and I'm pretty sure it's over a million miles now. I finally convinced her last week to replace it(she has been driving back and forth every other weekend to take care of my uncle in another state 4 hours away). I just didn't want her to get stuck on i70 between Indiana and Ohio where my dad and I would have to go pick her up in the middle of the night, and search for whatever mile marker she got stuck at. About a year ago I replaced her battery and alternator(original alternator). Half a year ago I replaced the rear shocks(they were the factory shocks). The rear top hat on the drivers side snapped from rusting through, so I swapped both in the rear. I then replaced the brakes a month later, front were okay but rear shoes were factory shoes with the paint marks. When I did the brakes and shocks I looked at the underside and it was similar but wayyyyy worse. Main concern would be water getting into the roof. My moms quarters were gone, the side rails were starting to crumble, doors rusting on the lower corners, subframe/control arms weren't too bad but you could tell it wasn't surface rust anymore. Well 2 weeks ago she ran over a tractor recap on the interstate, two days later her exhaust blew out and she said it was loud. I had to tell her that her car is so rusty that once I pull a piece of the exhaust off, it'd be likely that I have to replace every connecting exhaust piece up to the head. That was the point she finally decided to go replace the car. The engine is still halfway decent, I haven't ran compression tests or anything, but it just smokes a little at high rpm and is a little down on power. But that's it. She now still drives it around town only. TLDR; mom has a million mile Corolla from 06 that she finally replaced for her daily 108 mile work commute.",

Here’s what the seller shared: • Car has a rebuilt title but has already passed a safety inspection • Recently replaced to pass safety: • New windshield • All 4 tires (comes with both winters and all-seasons) • Full exhaust • Used transmission with 200,000 km • New clutch release bearing • Oil pressure sensor • Both outer tie rods replaced • Full front-end alignment • New tail light • New rear bumper • New serpentine belt • VTEC crossover at 5000 RPM • Has a crackle tune • All maintenance records and receipts included • Clear coat is peeling on the roof and front bumper, but the rest of the body looks solid The owner says they enjoyed the car but are selling to get a truck. Price is firm, no trades. Questions: • How concerned should I be about the rebuilt title? • What else should I be checking before buying this car? • Anything on the repair list raise red flags? • Are there common issues with 2007 Civic Sis I should know about? Appreciate any insight—really don’t want to get in over my head here. Thanks in advance!",

I was thinking about replacing it with the Mopar part (68596317AB) or the Doorman (926-959) Does anyone have experience with this particular part? How good is the quality and durability of the Mopar housing? Are there any other brands or solutions you would recommend? Any advice or experience would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advanced",

As for you, well, your GF (ex- maybe, although I hope you make up) sounds like she is not the mechanically oriented one. And you are here discussing it. So maybe you should start to see yourself as the one who is going to look after her car, because she obviously won't. Go a step further, and buy some tools. Good ones. Start doing your oil changes, brakes, rotating tires. I assume you don't do any of those things already, because, if you did, you would have already been checking her car for her. Car repair can be a fun hobby. And it saves a ton of money.",

The tire is so worn out that not only can see the steel frame the tread has, but some of the layers on the right side are even completely cut off, which is a very big red flag that you need new tires. Also, that tire wear on the right side NEEDS to be corrected for the next set, you should have a nice and flat wear pattern across the entire width of the tire, not something like this. For reference, there are these little bumps on the outskirts on the tread, should have a straight line through it, and there all over the outer edge of the tire.
