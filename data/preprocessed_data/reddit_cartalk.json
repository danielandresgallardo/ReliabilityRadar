    "selftext": "Hey, are you a licensed mechanic? **We appreciate you**, and want to make it so you stand out from the crowd. That's why we're offering custom flair to mechanics now! Just send the mods a [mail message ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/Cartalk)with a photo of your certs, with the personal information blocked out, and include in the photo with a handwritten note that has your reddit name and today's date on it. We will review and update your flair with a super special custom mechanic flair. Want to help mod the sub? Message us about that as well. We're open to getting active people with good car knowledge on board. Just like if you were a mechanic, you'll be severely underpaid ($0/yr) and will get to interact regularly with people who can be crass and impolite. We're looking to add at least three more mods at this time. Don't worry, we won't tell the Snap-On guy where you're working now. Happy New Year!",

Personally I think I should keep it, it only needs a little work, my biggest worry is the transmission it has a certain way you need to drive to keep it happy. In the three years I've had it, it only broke down once, which was about two weeks from when it was giving me signs something wasn't right. And even though it did break down it still ran decent enough for me to drive it over to autozone to fix it. I'm honestly split, on one side it's been an amazing truck and always fulfilled its role. One the other I know it's got 300k miles on the original power train. What say you reddit people?",

If it were me? Assuming no frame (etc.) problems, I'd start by checking out whether that fender can be replaced easily by one from an self-serve auto-wrecker. But I doubt it. It *might* be possible to intentionally cut the rusted parts off, cut the corresponding good parts off of one from the wrecker, and do a swap; then weld, fill, prime, paint, clear coat. Going the other route by trying to fix what's there, I'd still use a welder to replace some of the metal rather than trying to build it all back with putty alone. Realistically? Chip & sand off as much rust as you can, mask it off, spray it with several coats of rust paint, and keep an eye on it.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I‚Äôm a student on a tight budget and I‚Äôm really stressed about my car right now. I drive a petrol Peugeot 207 with about 145,000 km on it. About a month ago, I had the oil level checked and it was fine. Today on the highway, I noticed the car was vibrating hard and I couldn‚Äôt get past 90 km/h. The check engine light came on. I pulled over and saw that the oil level was extremely low ‚Äî almost nothing showing on the dipstick. I added oil right away (I didn‚Äôt notice any leaks under the car), but when I restarted the engine, it was vibrating badly and making a clicking or ticking noise. Over the next hour, I had to restart the car a few times to move it, and the noise and vibrations gradually went away. Now, it seems to be better. A mechanic will see the car tomorrow, but I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll tell me the engine is toast. Do you think the engine could still be okay? Or should I prepare for the worst? Thanks for taking the time of reading all of this",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I have a Volvo 740 -1987 with the B200K engine (carbureted, manual choke). I've been noticing some jerky behavior when driving, specifically in low gears: When I let off the gas and coast using engine braking (especially in 1st or 2nd gear), and then press the throttle again, the car jolts or \"jerks\" briefly before smoothing out. It's like a hesitation or harsh transition between deceleration and acceleration. This doesn't happen in higher gears like 4th or 5th ‚Äî it's mainly noticeable in the lower ones. Some additional context: * The idle is usually stable around 800‚Äì850 rpm, but sometimes when approaching a stop and letting off the gas, the idle drops too low (around 500‚Äì600 rpm). A quick blip of the throttle brings it back to normal. * The carburetor has been adjusted previously and emissions were fine during inspection. * The choke is fully manual, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fully disengaged when warm. Possible causes I‚Äôve considered: * Drivetrain slack (like in the driveshaft, u-joints, or diff bushings) * Slight carburetor delay or mixture transition * Weak or worn engine/trans mounts * Ignition timing or mixture slightly off * or maybe its just \"feature\" of an old rwd car Has anyone experienced similar behavior on a carbureted Redblock engine or older Volvo in general? I'd appreciate any suggestions or insight. Thanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. I was wondering if you guys could help me out. Since all of you are more experienced than I am. Inspected my car a little bit and noticed a couple of issues with my brakes, serpentine belt/tensioner, suspension. Its 2005 golf 5 plus 1.6fsi. I drive maybe 30kms each weekend. Its my first car, so I dont want to baby it. Just want to keep it roadworthy, safe and dont want to neglect it. Im adding a bunch of photos and a couple of videos. 1. As I understand, I need new brake discs, that for sure. In theory I could keep the brake pads, but since they are contaminated with all the rust and junk from the rotors, it would be wise to change the pads too? Plus I dont understand if brake calipers are done, or are they fine? https://imgur.com/a/mIWcRFr 2. I dont know what this rusty part is, but I tapped it with iron rod and it doesnt sound hollow. To me it seems like surface rust. Should I brush it with wire brush to be sure, or something? https://imgur.com/a/M0YZuSo 3. When buying the car I was told that the engine consumes oil. So I always was just adding the oil and checking its level regularly. I noticed that the bottom of the engine is covered with (fresh ?) oil. So I guess the engine does not burn it, but it just leaks it in this place. I know that there are some cases when engine really burns the oil and adding the oil to it is cheaper option instead of fixing the root cause. Is that the case? https://imgur.com/a/qmr1BoY 4. I took a look at the car suspension (tried googling how this part is called exactly, but no proper info on it). That thing that absorbs road bumps (coil, strut, absorber, idk). The rear ones have a little bit of rust on the rubber. And the front ones have some rust at the bottom of the springs. How much life these things at the front have left? https://imgur.com/a/79Nft7E 5. No idea how this part is called in english, but I see some rust on it, some flaking of black paint, but it sound solid. As I understand, its fine? https://imgur.com/a/fpQHzhl 6. Lower control arms in the front are fine too? https://imgur.com/a/h1w1qNp 7. When starting a car theres a high pitched chirping sound. How to diagnose it? Is it one the pulleys, tensioner, loose belt, worn belt? https://imgur.com/a/S4Fg8Cq How to check other parts of my suspension, drivetrain? How to know what parts should move and what parts shouldnt? Thank you so much for any help !",

        "body": "1. They don't look great, but if all the brake pads have about that much material left, and the car is stopping alright, you can let it go for a while longer. Eventually you want to replace the pads, rotors, knock the rust of the calipers and brackets so they can move, and flush the brake fluid. 2. That's the steering knuckle and it has normal surface rust, which is best left alone. You'll want to learn how to check ball joints, tie rod ends, and wheel bearings to see if those need attention. YouTube will have videos on the subject. 3. It all depends on where the oil leak is as for the difficulty of the fix. The most common leak is valve cover gaskets. Oil runs downhill of course, so if you can wipe just below the valve cover and find fresh oil, that's the starting point and you need a new valve cover gasket. What I can see of the oil pan seal looks alright. Every engine has multiple seals and gaskets to hold the oil in, and any one of them can fail. If you're not having any results looking for the leak, try degreasing the engine and see where the oil comes back first. 4. That picture didn't load but I'll assume you're taking about coil springs. Surface rust is fine. A broken coil spring is not. You can try bouncing each corner of the car to decide if the suspension needs work, and again, YouTube videos can show you what to look for, and you can judge how the car handles after going over a pothole or bump. 5. That's the axle, or \"half-shaft\" and it looks like surface rust. Generally that black rubber boot will fail first, and throw grease all over everything near. There is a boot at each end of the shaft. When the boot fails you need a new axle. If you can catch it in time it's possible to just change the boot but it's messy and time consuming. 6. Also surface rust. When the ball joints and bushings start to fail, you can replace the whole control arm. 7. Usually that is due to worn bearings in an idler pulley. Could also be the belt tensioner, or the belt itself. Best practice is to replace the idler pulley(s), and belt tensioner when you replace the belt. You can use a mechanics stethoscope to hunt for the source of the noise when the engine is running, but it's hard to get to some parts. Or, with the engine off, remove the belt and try spinning the idler pulleys. They should turn free and not wobble, and if they don't spin easy or wobble, you need new a new pulley.",

Another cool thing was the automatic radio antenna that would raise and lower when you turned on the radio. And a lot of cars had a center armrest in the front bench seat. That's a pet peeve I have with modern cars is that you don't have a good armrest in the right spot for either right or left arm.

Look for \"Color Code\" or \"Paint Code\" followed by letters and/or numbers. 2.Purchase the correct touch-up paint: Get one that matches your car's specific paint code. You can often find these at auto parts stores (e.g., AutoZone, O'Reilly, Advance Auto Parts in the US; similar stores exist globally), online retailers (Amazon, eBay), or sometimes even at your car dealership (though dealerships tend to be slightly more expensive for the same product). 3. Clean it, with a microfiber cloth or any good cloth, use a little alcohol but not to much as to not damage the paint 4.Apply the color paint: Shake the pen/bottle well. For a thin scratch, use the pen tip or the very edge of the brush to apply a very thin layer of paint into the scratch only. Avoid painting outside the scratch as much as possible..Let the first layer dry for 10-15 minutes (or as per product instructions). Apply another thin layer if needed to fill the scratch. The goal is to build up the paint slightly above the surrounding surface, as it will shrink slightly as it dries. 5. (Optional) apply a thin layer of clear coat and let it dry and cure for about 24/48 hours 6. (Optional) you can polish it",

    "selftext": "So I have a situation with my tires, and I'm prepared to hear the hundreds of differing opinions on the matter. For context, I'm due for the NYS annual inspection, and one of the areas they check are tires. The first picture is the damage to the back rear tire, and I'll say I plan to replace this anyway. However, both out of curiosity and in the unlikely event that I cannot get it replaced before the inspection, would it pass inspection as is? The second question is when I replace the tires, which ones should I replace (conventional wisdom says replacing two at a time is best). The second picture shows minor damage to the front tire, inclining me to replace that one in addition to the more damaged rear tire. My main debate at the moment is which tires to replace and where they should all end up. For the record, these tires are on a GTI (which is front wheel drive), and the tires are worn very evenly from inside to out. Both front tires are at 6/32, and both rears are at 8/32 (each across the whole width of the tire, my alignment is on point). The question is should I: 1. Replace the two rear tires (including the one in the first pic), to maintain the tread height the same across the axle (and painfully, replacing one undamaged tire at 8/32) or, 2. Replace the two pictured tires (understanding the damage on the front is minimal), replacing one from the front and one from the back. And in that case, where should I mount the new tires? I know conventional wisdom says to mount them on the back to prevent oversteer, but I would rather them be on the front, as being a front wheel drive car, the front wears significantly quicker. I would also like to avoid having a significant difference in tire tread across the front driven axle to reduce stress on the differential, although if I put a new tire on the front passenger side and rotate the intact rear tire to the front the difference in tread depth would only be 2/32. Now, I would rather have this tread difference on the back, installing both new tires in the front (against conventional wisdom) and bringing the undamaged front tire to the rear, so that the rear (undriven) axle has one tire at 6/32 and one at 8/32. A tread depth difference of 2/32 across the undriven axle is practically negligible, but again out of sheer curiosity, how long would that take to even out? I could also reverse this arrangement, placing the two new tires on the rear following conventional wisdom and have a tread depth difference of 2/32 across the driven axle (which is the maximum allowable difference across a driven axle for most VAG cars). Worst case scenario is I replace the two damaged tires and leave them where they are, in which case I would have a tread difference of 4/32 in the front (which I would really rather avoid), and 2/32 in the back. I know I'm nitpicking here, and ultimately the differences are quite small. But since I have the time and free will to write this out and entertain the debate, here I am. Apologies for the giant wall of text, and I welcome all reasonable opinions. TIA! **TL;DR:** Front at 6/32, rear at 8/32. Damage to rear and front driver side tires (pictured, respectively). Which 2 tires to replace and what positions should all the tires end up in?",

If the coolant was really old the cooling system could be a rusty mess. Need to go through the brakes and flush the brake fluid. If it was really old you may need lots of new parts in the brake system as brake fluid attracts moisture and when left to sit that moisture wreaks havoc. Fuel may have deteriorated. Fuel pump likely has already failed or will fail quickly if it did. Tires need to be replaced if they're over 7 years old or dry rotted.

Around 15-20 years old, dirt cheap on the second hand market, considered a good option as a project car. Lowered suspension and loud exhaust kit are the obvious modifications, but if I know anything about these type of dudes, it also has a lot of \"rice\" accessories. To make it short, this douchebag took that nice project car and turned into a douchemobile. The actual reason why somone does this is because they hate someone in the neighbourhood and they want to annoy them. However their raw gasoline-infested brain cannot perceive the fact that there are numerous other people living in the area. In some other countries this act usually ends up with some sleepy-eyed angry dudes using the driver's body to redecorate the car, but you live in a civilized world and your only option is to call the police on them.",

    "selftext": "So a few weeks ago or maybe 1-2 months ago my oil pressure light started to come on. It was very inconsistent but was mostly triggered by high RPM but not always. At first it just started blinking and then gradually turning into being on at all times. Sometimes I had it fora 2-3 days in a row sometimes I didnt have it for a week. The engine was running completely fine otherwise for weeks. Now at some point the check engine light came on with it and there is no turbo boost which is probably related but the car still runs fine otherwise. No weird noise, no overheating engine, nothing besides the turbo boost. When this first appeared I drove it for 1-1,5 week and changed the oil as it was time for it anyways and it was a bit higher then the maximum and the oil seemed normal. No particles or anything in it. Now I know im an idiot for driving the car like this but I had no option. Now im looking more into what this could be and im wondering if this can just be a faulty sensor since the only thing that happened during this long time is the loss of turbo boost (which might even be unrelated since I think it was on its way out anyways). Am I right to think this is most likely just the sensor or can other issue be this \"harmless\" regarding the oil pressure light? I feel like my engine would be cooked after driving it for so long with actual bad oil pressure but i dont know enough about the subject to say for sure.",

The cars got a Sports cat, BFB diverter valve and a induction kit, I know the prince engines were also used in the THP200/Mini cooper S doing about 220 bph after remap. Does the part above the 5500 rpm look like a flow restriction or the turbo capping out? I can source a turbo from a thp200 (or 208 GTI etc) that are larger and produce more boost and are a straight bolt on. Would the car be able to run normally without having to get it remapped again, or would I have to get it remapped right away as I'm planning on upgrading the intercooler and exhaust as well before the map?",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I‚Äôm trying to get some outside perspectives here. What would you do in my situation? I have a 2008 ford expedition el king ranch 4x4 with 150k miles that I inherited almost 10 years ago. It‚Äôs been our family road trip truck and we love it. After our last trip, just when we arrive home, the check engine light came on. Local mechanic quoted $6k of work needed including: early fuel evap canister w/solenoid, serpentine belt, 2 heater hoses, cooling system service, both valve cover gaskets, schrader valve and AC system service, both upper suspension control arms and joints, alignment, and new tires. That quote doesn‚Äôt include the extra diagnostics for the rear air suspension leak and that fix, as well as differentials and transfer case service. The rear axles are also seeping - we were told we could just keep an eye on it but I‚Äôm concerned of those being a possible safety issue and mounting damage. We worry if we spend this money, probably being $8000 or more, then something else may soon break and we‚Äôd have spent all that money just to have to replace the vehicle anyway or spend another however many thousands to continue fixing it. We had planned a national park tour for this summer and fall, and planned on using the truck to tow a smaller travel trailer (the truck has the HD tow package and we understand payload and all that). This really threw a wrench in the plans. Newer comparable expeditions we‚Äôve looked at are about $35-40k with ~50-70k miles and most all are out of warranty, so if anything went wrong, we‚Äôd have an $800 monthly payment (~10% apr, which is ridiculously high) and then have the potential to pay for any repair that‚Äôs needed if it happens. I‚Äôve read the newer expeditions are having engine, transmission, and brake problems which is especially concerning for us buying it used and driving it around in the mountains/rural areas/towing. Also, if we take that monthly payment for a newer car, we‚Äôd have to trade in our other car that we‚Äôre making payments on ~$500/month) since we don‚Äôt feel comfortable with almost $1500 monthly in car payments. This would then leave us with only 1 car - not a *major* inconvenience as my husband works remotely and I‚Äôm home with the kids, but I will be going to grad school next year. Neither situation is great, but I‚Äôd love if anyone can give some input. Thanks in advance!",

Recently, I manually pushed up the driver side lock pin inside to unlock all doors, and I felt something move or give way inside the lock. Now, when I use the remote, all doors lock normally, but the driver side door doesn‚Äôt unlock remotely. I have to enter through another door and unlock the driver side manually.

    "selftext": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/s/pp5h9etKLR Quick update from my post last week: I installed a new alternator (took ~2 hours, no issues). The old one was covered in oil, so I need to replace the oil gasket. Problem is, the new alternator didn‚Äôt fix the voltage issue. It still drops to 11.5v, and maxes out around 13.5v. Weirdly, if I turn on the blower (low) or headlights, it stays steady at 13.3‚Äì13.5v. Is it safe to drive like this if it holds in the 13v range under load? So now I‚Äôm looking at: - Bad oil gasket - Maybe a bad ELD? - New battery (1 month old) - New alternator (1 day old) I‚Äôve driven an hour using the blower trick with no battery light. Planning to take it to a shop next week for a deeper electrical/fuse box check. Any advice appreciated.",

I came in last weekend got the filter done, and otw home I was on the highway when I heard thumping. Initially thought I blew a tire but when I got out I saw the skid plate under my car was dragging. My brother came to help n said the car didn‚Äôt have any clips holding it up. Next day he got some clips and put it back up, but said I was still missing a few. Brought my car back to the shop today (third weekend in a row now) they put the clips back in but said half the skid plate broke off. They told me they didn‚Äôt have to touch the skid plate for the fluid or filter and that I prob hit something that caused it to break. The thing is, the plate wasn‚Äôt damaged at all (or at least I have never had a shop mention it to me and the other shop I bring my car to tells me legit EVERYTHING) so I don‚Äôt think it was previously damaged so why would it just fall off?? Idk I don‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt touch the plate, I watched a video on YouTube and it looks like they remove it for the filter but idk I‚Äôm not a mechanic and I also work with this girl (it‚Äôs her bfs shop) so I don‚Äôt want to accuse them if maybe the plate was broken? Idk I‚Äôm just finding it hard to believe when it was legit hours after I left the shop. Idk someone please give me advice I‚Äôm waiting for them to tell me how much a new plate will be.",

So I had to call a tow and had them bring it to my normal shop to fix it mind you been going been going there forever but his son is taking over and now the shop is terrible‚Ä¶ they called said it was the fuel pump and they put a new one in an said I was good to go. I go to pick up my truck make it a mile down the road and it stalls out. Called the shop obviously pissed they came and got it and and said the pumps under warranty and they would see what happen‚Ä¶ two weeks later when they finally got to it they said it was a faulty pump and they replaced it and I‚Äôm good to go.. picked it up drove home noticed the engine light still blinking and some shaking when I hit 50 mph made it home and next day the truck is doing the exact thing again crank no start.. I just paid them $428 to do the pump an I feel like that was never the issue. With money being tight I couldn‚Äôt afford to bring it anywhere else or pay another tow so I‚Äôm trying to fix this myself. The codes it was throwing p0207 and p03000 and p0113 did some research and checked all my wiring to fuel injector 7 and replaced fuel injector 7 that didn‚Äôt work. Also checked wiring to the air temperature sensor and replaced air temperature sensor and that also didn‚Äôt work. Along with that I‚Äôve tested the fuel pressure which is completely fine and I hear my fuel pump turn on so I know that‚Äôs not it. I also checked my fuses and fuse relay and that wasn‚Äôt the issue. I‚Äôm honestly starting to feel defeated and pissed that I paid these guys to fix the issue and I‚Äôm still here with a crank no start. Never going there again obviously and called and lost my shit on them cause I truthfully need my truck for work and my kids and feel like I got fucked over big time. If you‚Äôre still even reading I appreciate any advice of what I should do next or if anyone would know what could cause this.",

IROC edition started in 84 or 85 and ended in 90. But it was the first year for that body style. Pros: 305 yanked out, 350 dropped in. Bored 30 over, making it a 355. Mild cam, flat top pistons. 4 speed Manual Borg Warner transmission (only available in the 82 and half of the 83 model years). Cons: frame rotted out right where the clutch linkage mounts to it. I'm kicking around the idea of getting an '84 or later bell housing for the transmission and converting it to hydraulic clutch, cutting away the rotten parts of the frame and welding it up with plate steel. Otherwise I'm yanking the engine and transmission to put into a third gen in better condition and parting this one out. I feel like the latter is the safer option as no body shop in my area seems too eager to touch it, but I hate to crush a classic. Here's a vid from when I last had it on the road (a couple Japanese guys here on visas working for Honda were fascinated by it and wanted to go for a ride, so I got a bit silly) . I still put a little gas in it and run it in neutral occasionally to keep the engine in decent condition.",

    "selftext": "Alright, I need to get this off my chest and hear some real opinions, because I am genuinely perplexed. The Mini Cooper Countryman. Every time I see one on the road, I just find myself staring, not in admiration, but in confusion. Does anyone genuinely look at that car and think, \"Yes, that's the one for me! I'm trying to be fair here. It's not terrible. I mean, it drives. It has wheels. It has some of that classic Mini styling that a lot of people seem to dig, and the interior can be quirky and distinct, which is a nice break from blandness. But honestly, beyond the aesthetics, I just don't see the compelling argument for its existence, let alone for purchasing one. Here's my ever-growing list of grievances and questions: * It's not that \"mini\" anymore (and that's the whole point, isn't it?): The entire allure of a Mini, historically, was its compact size, its almost kart-like nimble handling, and its uncanny ability to squeeze into tight city spots. It was a unique proposition. The Countryman? It's a small crossover. It's bigger than its siblings, meaning it loses that core \"mini\" identity. It's like going to a steakhouse and ordering a salad you're fundamentally missing the point. * But it's not a proper SUV either: So, it's bigger than a regular Mini. Great. But it's not exactly spacious or rugged like a true SUV. You're not hauling a ton of gear, nor is it going to conquer any off-road trails more challenging than a gravel driveway, now obviously not all SUVs are made to be rugged or taken off road, however it still doesn't have what a regular SUV would. It just feels like it occupies this weird, ill-defined, inbetween space where it's not particularly good at being either a genuinely compact, fun-to-drive Mini or a practical, versatile small SUV. It's the automotive equivalent of a platypus confusing and seemingly stitched together from disparate parts. * The Reliability Elephant in the Room (Thanks, BMW): Okay, let's talk about probably one of the worst qualities. Mini is owned by BMW. And while BMWs are fantastic to drive, their reputation for long-term reliability and wallet friendly maintenance isn't exactly stellar. From what I've seen and heard, especially with earlier Countryman models (thinking 2011-2015 era), engine issues like timing chain failures, high-pressure fuel pump problems, and excessive oil consumption were alarmingly common. And let's not forget the anecdotes of transmission woes or even things like exploding sunroofs While newer models (2020+) are supposedly better, that historical baggage weighs heavily. When you're buying a car known for its \"fun\" factor, you don't expect the fun to stop abruptly with a massive repair bill. * The Cost of \"Fun\" (and then fixing it): This brings me to the absolute clincher: the value proposition. For the price, and let's be real, Mini can get expensive fast, especially when you start ticking option boxes what are you really getting? You're paying premium money for a car that, despite its attempts at being a crossover, often comes with a stiff ride (especially with those dreaded run-flat tires) and a history of potential mechanical headaches. And when those headaches strike, remember that BMW ownership means parts and labor are not \"cheap.\" Routine maintenance is more expensive than average, and a significant repair can set you back thousands. You're essentially paying premium money for something that doesn't quite fit any mold, might break down, and will then cost you an arm and a leg to fix. It's not bad, but it's not great. It's just... there? It feels like a stylistic choice that compromises on practicality, true \"mini-ness,\" and long-term financial sense. It's the car that makes me go, \"Who is this for, exactly?\" Am I missing some secret sauce to the Countryman that I'm just not seeing? Is the driving experience so sublime that it makes up for all these glaring compromises? Or is it purely about the aesthetic and the brand loyalty for those who want a Mini but... bigger? Change my mind, or tell me I'm not alone in this lol.",

There is no sign of misfire, just the car shaking alot including the steering wheel on idle and when stopped at a red light in drive. (You can hear the car shaking, its loud) The mechanic also said that I have compression rates of 100, 130, 130, and 130. So cylinder 1 is losing compression. I am quite literally terrified because I have a a feeling thousands of dollars of repairs are coming to the engine. Head gasket has been ruled out, it could be a valve or a piston ring. (The car sat all winter and wasn't driven too much until I bought it, (previous owner cleaned fuel injector recently and there is no rust on the car at all) (I have not yet done a leakdown test because If I hear the results and its as bad as I hoped, I will probably regret everything but I will do one in the next 2 weeks for sure) Anyone have any ideas or help?",

I'm really not sure why but I've been avoiding dropping them off at Advance Auto, AutoZone, etc. but I have.

The filter IS NOT the restriction preventing your engine from making more power. Yes K&N media flows more air than paper filter media, in a lab test hooked up to perfect clear plastic tubing; but on an engine dyno, the filter itself is basically transparent to the engine. You can run back to back to back tests with a paper filter, K&N, and NO filter, and see absolutely no difference, assuming you make no other changes. It's been done and proven countless times. K&N got the reputation for making power at best because people were replacing restrictive air intake systems with open filter elements. The whole \"buy it once and reuse it forever\" thing is a false economy unless your OEM-replacement paper air filters are unusually expensive. I calculated that for my daily driver the breakeven point of a K&N is somewhere around 300,000 miles, depending on how many cleanings I could get out of the cleaning kit.

So \"performance\" filters that let in more air, also let in more particles. But the particles are bad for the engine, bad for the turbo and that's generally the whole point of an air filter.

This isn't need for speed where you slap a \"stage 1 upgrade\" and instantly get 100 hp. Most street cars are not Nissan GTRs where you can get 1000 hp from their engines. Any hp gain is a plus. As for particles, they are not an issue if you change oil every 5k miles or less. With added performance comes more maintenance, that's the reality (see BMWs for example). If you aren't ready for that , then don't modify your car. But please don't try to downplay engine modifications if you don't like them.",

Sometimes the vibrations are minor, other times more noticeable. I‚Äôve tested whether the vibrations are related to the engine, and I can confirm that they still occur even when the car is in neutral, so it seems to be related to the road surface or suspension. * The issue occurs with both sets of wheels, summer and winter The summer tires are brand new (Continental ContiSportContact A0 19-inch) * I‚Äôve replaced all four upper front control arms with Lemf√∂rder parts, except one which is a Sidem brand (front passenger side, upper rear) * A wheel alignment was performed after replacing the control arms, which improved handling and reduced some vibration \\> Note -> Only the seats do have vibration, probably from the floor. Steering wheel is fine. I was told by an independent mechanic that the electro-hydraulic engine mount on the passenger side has lost some fluid and should be replaced and then another wheel alignment performed. Another shop advised waiting until the check engine light comes on and then replacing all three mounts, two engine mounts and one transmission mount I‚Äôm unsure how to proceed Any help is appreciated",

I can say that on perfectly smooth roads, the seats do not vibrate. However, if the road is bumpy or uneven, the seats start to vibrate. Also, when the car is idling, the seat vibrates consistently, though only at the headrest. If I shift the gear to \"N\" and press the gas pedal (raising the engine RPM above 2000), the seat no longer vibrates. To clarify the IDLE, I am referring to a minor vibration felt only at the head of the seat while IDLE",

He suggested leaving it in as it didn't seem to be leaking. I went to another tire shop on my way home. They lifted the car, sprayed some water and said there's an extremely minor leak. He suggested replacing the tire but said if you don't want to right now just keep filling air if it's losing pressure slowly. Between the time I noticed the nail and driving to the tire shops and coming home, I have driven more than 50 miles and the pressure is still intact. Is there a risk of blowout or an accident? It's a Yokohama yk740 gtx running at about 40k miles with a tread depth of 6. As it's an AWD, I'd have to replace all 4 tires.

So basically what I‚Äôm really saying is, it‚Äôs gonna cost you quite a bit more to get the specs perfect. If your car doesn‚Äôt pull and the steering wheel is straight you‚Äôre probably good.

    "selftext": "Throughout most of my life, I have gotten sick inside vehicles quite often. I used to chock it up to motion sickness, but I'm not so certain that is a complete explanation for it. Here are some things I've noticed: * It is pretty exclusive to gas powered vehicles, I've never gotten sick or felt close to getting sick (as will be described later) inside of an EV. * I almost always feel very mildly sick inside of a gas powered vehicle, to the point where I do feel worse than normal but it is often somewhat easy to supress vomiting. * The smell of gas will is the single worst trigger here, and I usually gag (and eventually vomit) if the smell of gas or exhaust fumes inside the cabin is particarly strong. * Another very strong trigger is having the AC on. In the hundreds of models of cars I've been in, having the AC has always made me feel sicker and close to throwing up without fail. * Sudden turns combined with the two factors above is often a trigger * Opening windows usually helps quite alot, but it helps the most when the car is in motion and I can feel the air/wind blowing on me. The best explanation I have for this is likely a combination of motion sickness as a minor factor (since certain turns and such can trigger it) but with the more major factor seemingly being some sort of hypersensitivity to even relatively slight amounts of cabin pollution. When I first rode inside of an EV for the first time, I was shocked to find out just how normal and well I felt compared to every gas-powered car I've been in. Since than, I've been in EVs more and have never felt even remotely sick inside of one. Naturally, I have tried to search some of these (symptoms?) up only to find results that are at best tangentially related to what I am actually looking for. Considering that some of what I experience doesn't seem to be super common from what I can tell, another frustrating thing is that people often don't get or dismiss me when I ask for an accommodation that would lower the risk of me throwing up. Most common example of that is I oftentimes ask the driver for the AC to be turned off or for me to open the window to let some fresh air in, both often times rejected by driver as they want the AC to be on for comfort and opening the window would also impede that. Does anyone here know what I might be experiencing? Again, I don't think motion sickness quite explains it. This also isn't anything new, it's happened for basically as long as I can remember riding inside of a vehicle. Does the explanation I came up with hold any weight? I apologise if some of my terminology is incorrect, I'm not really much of a \"car person\" and thus might not use the correct terms for some things.",

I went out of town recently to visit family and my boyfriend took the car on a little road trip (340 miles each way). Before leaving, he did good on checking fluids, adding coolant, oil level good, etc. Made it there and back just fine. As soon as he was pulling into the driveway, it was hitching and check engine light went on. He checked fluids again and looks like it lost a ton of oil, so he added. He also found out at that point that he had forgotten to put the cap back on the coolant reservoir so he went that whole trip without it. Yikes. So I got home, ordered a cap for the coolant, plug in a scanner and get code P0017 (crankshaft/camshaft position). I jimmy rig a temp. cap for the coolant with a small bag and rubber bands. No more check engine light after that, but the engine now making a whirring sound while accelerating, and after parking, the oil light is blinking on and off. I checked the oil and its at an ok level. So I'm imagining I need a new oil pump, but what is causing the whirring? Is this engine toast? Can't get it in anywhere until Tuesday (damn holiday weekend) so I'm not driving it til then.",

I haven‚Äôt noticed any visible signs of leaking ( i park on cement and light coloured pavement so i think i might have noticed by now). i also checked my oil levels and they‚Äôre still full. i don‚Äôt know if the dealer is trying to scam me or if it‚Äôs even as urgent as they‚Äôre making it sound. they‚Äôve quoted me $360 aud to get it repaired. any advice would be appreciated. thank you!!",

My fiance also drives car B and has a habit of putting the car in drive while still rolling in reverse. (drives me insane, not sure if it actually affects longevity of the car). WWYD? Is the potential difference in longevity worth the $3500 I‚Äôd pay to keep Car A? Selling Car B and paying off Car A is also off the table for some long, obnoxious reasons.",

It typically goes to 2000 RPMs and then slowly goes down but it has been going to the 2000 then almost stalling to 1300-1500 and then jumps back up to 2000. There is no dash light on and I just don‚Äôt know what the issue could be. I‚Äôll also emphasize that it doesn‚Äôt do it on every start up only ones after it sits for a little and that it runs perfectly normal throughout the day. I attached a video of the engine bay and the dash, in the engine bay one you can clearly hear it begin to stall and then go back to normal (ignore the squeaking belt as it got wet from the rain the other night).

    "selftext": "\\[SOLVED\\] - replaced coolant sensor, fixed Situation:Car drives fine, but after about 5 miles and a stop in a gas station or store, when driving back the car will begin to putter/stall and get close to dying at stop lights and stop signs. If I pump the gas pedal it will revive it. Once the car stalled, and if i pump the gas pedal it will start again, but it seems this problem has gotten worse in 3 consecutive drives - being slight but noticeable drive one, a little bit alarming drive 2, and downright scary drive 3. SOLUTION: REPLACED COOLANT TEMPERATURE SENSOR MYSELF: \\- this took draining 1 gallon of coolant \\- replacing $30 coolant sensor from O'Reilly's \\- re-fill coolant \\- run car for 10 minutes with radiator cap off to let new air purge from coolant system. accelerate a few times to help that along RESULTS: To find this solution, i first \\- cleaned the MAF sensor \\- cleaned the PCV valve \\- checked the IACV, it was not clogged (you need to get a replacement gasket for this to put back on car, the gasket is complex and it swells in use, so you can't get it back in place to re-used the gasket). \\- was going to check the ECT but my car doesn't have one! \\- I was about to do a fuel pressure test and questioned the fuel pump, but with ChatGPT's help, he convince me it was more likely temperature related since it only happens after driving a while, and it was easier to try the coolant sensor as well! I did the swap and the problem disappeared",

        "body": "Most lower priced Sealed Lead Acid (SLA - which has been the most common automotive battery for a long time) batteries use cheaper materials and/ or have less plates inside to store the energy. The result will be a battery that has the cranking amps needed for a certain application/ application range, but maybe not a great reserve capacity. These can be $80 to maybe $200 (In Canada so adjust for local currency) Higher priced batteries, can be the opposite, or have a different design/ chemical makeup inside; higher end SLA batteries can be better made, and or have more plates, while AGM (Absorbed Glass Mat) batteries are similar they have fiberglass matting between the plates, to absorb the battery acid which has its benefits. Though there are many AGM producers, Optima is more than likely the most recognizable, as they have had a good reputation, and primarily produce AGMs. You may hear mixed reviews of them, but I've had nothing but good experiences with them. Better quality SLAs can be about $200 to $400+ AGMs are becoming more and more popular, for a number of reasons, slowly phasing out the older SLA technologies as the power demand of newer vehicles continues to increase. These are often $300+ Lithium batteries, similar to E-bike batteries or really big phone batteries are also coming into the market which offer very high reliability, faster recharging, sometimes containing smaller Sodium- Ion reserve batteries to boost itself if the Lithium-Ion battery itself dies. Some also have Bluetooth capabilities, and built in battery warmers to keep themselves warm and alive during the cold months. These are $600+ often getting to $1500+ Reserve capacity is to give customers an idea of how long the battery can last outputting a certain amperage. 5Ah would be about 5 Amps for one hour, or 2.5 Amps for two hours, and that rating/ duration can be affected by everything mentioned above. All of these types of batteries will have \"cheaper\", potentially worse quality options, and more expensive, hopefully better quality options. Say your vehicle requires 180 amps to crank in warmer weather and 240 or something to crank while cold, that 5Ah can get used up pretty quickly - whatever that math works out to be... (If I remember correctly, a battery's cranking amps is the amps it can output for 30 seconds above 0‚Å∞C/ 32‚Å∞F and cold cranking is somewhere below those temperatures. If you want more information I could share some more, or the Google AI will tell you most of what you'd want to know if you look up AGM meaning or something similar. This is all from memory, so I could have mistaken some things, but most, if not all of it is accurate enough to give you at least a general idea of what you're wondering.",

So I don't know if this is just to be expected and I just need to be patient until they completely break in or if I did something wrong.

It currently runs on 75hp, with a 4 gear transmission (will upgrade the trans to at least 5). What are some recommendations? I was thinking of engine swapping to a C20LET 2.0L Turbocharged, though I can't find it anywhere yet. I'm a Dutch student, so my budget isn't very high though I would love to hear some ideas and possibilities! The car's in great condition, has basically no rust except for at the back window and front windshield underneath the window rubbers. I found someone who will fix this for me so then the car is in neat condition except for a few body marks that I will manage later on. I appreciate the people that will respond to this!",

CEL began flashing right after a highway drive ‚Äî literally right after I filled up at a gas station, so that might be related.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done so far: * Replaced **all spark plugs** and **coil packs** * Installed a new **fuel injector in Cylinder 5** (still misfiring = not the injector) * Scanned for live misfires and saw **Cylinders 1, 5, and 7** misfiring the most * Misfires slowly build at idle (was at about 30 misfire counts on cyl 1 at idle), but **spike fast at high RPM** * Haven‚Äôt done a **compression test yet**, that‚Äôs next on my list Setup details: * **2015 Charger SRT 392** * Tuned (Underground Tuning Stage 2) * **Advanced burble tune** * **High-flow cats** (possibly damaged from burbles?) * Scanner used: **JScan**, misfire counts verified live I‚Äôm getting consistent misfires **only on Bank 1,** except cyl 3? (Driver Side), while Bank 2 cylinders are clean. I‚Äôm starting to suspect a clogged high-flow cat on that side or something electrical/fuel related to Bank 1. Could it even be cam or lifter wear?

I'm in the used tire business and according to new regulation we are not to install any tire that is older than 7 years. Which is just a way to push the sell of more new tires. First of all not all tires are made the same.and some rubber compounds are just better and then not all tires.are made of the same amount of layers . It's not uncommon that iSwap out 20year old 10 ply tires that have served there owners well and then I Find 4 year old 4ply tire's with 70% tread life left that are dry rotted and I have no choice but to recommend replacing. Which I hate to do unless its absolutely necessary..after all I got into the business to save the planet not sell tires. But by keeping as many re usable tires on the road and as much money In ppls pockets as possible allows me to provide a huge service by keeping tire from Filling up the landfills and from making it to the bottom bottom of every river creek, lake, pond and ditch in my town and surrounding area .I encourage ppl to bring them to me and I'll dispose of them free of charge before they dump them on the side of the road . But anyway back on topic the major factor the determines the life of a tire is the environmental conditions it has been exposed to. Fortunately a donut is primarily housed inside of the vehicle somewhere and kept from being exposed to any elements primarily the sun. This significantly extends the life of a spare tire and if you find. 20 year old car that is well maintained it probably has its original spare tire in it and upon visual inspection unless it shows large dry rot crack or separation along the side wall of the tire, it's gonna do it job and get u off the side of the road and to a place you can replace the tire. I have know of ppl that put 1000 mile or drove on a spare for 5 months before buying a replacement tire . Remember keep the tire inflated properly and aviod speeds above 55. Personally I would try to stay under 45 and no high speed cornering or you will roll the tire right of the rim. The most important thing and this will save ur life , is that you never put a donut on a front. Tire. If you have a flat on the front, you jack up the whole side of the car and move the one from the back to the front.and put the donut on the back. Just in case the spare does fail you dont lose stearing and roll off in a ditch, get ejected from ur vehicle and it coming to rest on top of you, Which can really ruin ur day. But besides that you will be fine. Stay safe and remember to check ur tires often .the difference between making it to your destination safely and becoming a statistic is 4 magazine size piece of rubber that are responsible for keeping your 3- 5000lb vehicle and all it's contents connected to the road. I got a tires for every vehicle for any budget and offer payment options if need be and if you still can afford that you probably shouldn't be driving anyway but i ask customers if they want to round up to the next dollar or donate a couple bucks that go into a lil pot that I match every dollar that can be used to help in certain situations but there Is no excuse for riding on bald tire's with wire showing and you just lazy.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I have some electrical issues with Megane II 2.0 2008 (Gasoline, no LPG). When I pressed button for rear window heater, a trunk came open. It didn't happen mid-driving, but when I started the car. Sometimes, rear wiper also started moving. Later, same thing started happening when turning lights on and off. A day later, our left rear headlight died, not showing signs of any life except when hitting brake, turning signal or rear fog lights (rear left light, rear left position light and reverse light didn't work). Right side worked perfectly. Took it to mechanic, who fixed it temporarily, because it died 2 days later again. This time however, dashboard lights didn't cycle as we were changing light modes (it is supposed to change the dim of the light when cycling between no lights, position lights, lights on), but our rear left headlight worked as intended. However, now we have another problem with front position lights. They do not turn on whatsoever, while the rears turn on normally. Light is also on, working normally everywhere, but the front positions are not working now. Is there any idea to what may have caused this spike of electronic problems? Car have never been underwater, cleaning is done with water pressure guns ever since 2018 and never had such difficulties with a car. If you know how to fix this or have any suggestion to what may have caused all this, please drop it in the comments.",

All I did was wrap it in heat reflective tape it's good for keeping radiant heat from soaking into it. Generally speaking, most intake boxes are made to be as efficient as possible. There are some that offer improvements, but that involves a bit more work. They make a pod filter that has a corrugated tube on it having that tube insulated against the engine bay heat, and the tube in a place where it can get fresh air like a duct opening in the bumper that work just as good. But they make bolts on specifically made for that purpose. Be warned tho the cruse can get a check engine light from the filter box, not being closed all the way.

Any advice appreciated, thank you",

You could literally take apart the ECU, pull out a chip, and replace it with a new one with different programming. Chip tuning has largely been irrelevant since OBD2 came out in 1996, allowing for the ECU to be reprogrammed without removing it or taking it apart. With modern cars, you can buy a program for your laptop, connect said laptop to your car's OBD2 connector (using a cheap adapter), and reprogram it using the laptop. A lot of tuners work this way. Some companies will even sell prepackaged tunes for specific cars (EG: SCT). But chipping your car for more power is pretty much always a scam nowadays unless the car in question is from those ancient OBD1 (1988-1995) days. So yes. \"Chipping\" a car is a proper automotive term, but if you're talking about chipping a modern car, any auto enthusiast who knows anything is gonna know you're either old, gullible, or full of shit.

Since then, I got a new battery, changed the oil and filter, and have periodically tried starting it again with mixed results. Most of the time, nothing happens when I turn the key. Sometimes, the dash will light up then the engine will click as it does with a dead battery. Twice, it has actually turned over. The first time, it ran for a couple seconds. The second, it turned over, fired once, then died. The check engine and battery lights are showing on the dash. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.",

    "selftext": "So my girlfriend just recently got a used 2006 Ford Focus with some very very bald tires. We had some issues where it just felt like it's got a mind of its own, for example, when hitting a pothole it would feel like it goes further in to the pothole, and if it's raining real bad it will go all over the place like it's hydroplaning. It will stay facing forward and not totally lose control, but it will like swerve between lanes. We got 4 new tires not too long ago, thinking it would fix it, but it's still doing it. Could it be a suspension thing, and if so what part of the suspension would it be?",

It is a 2019 Toyota Aygo that is worth approx. 8000-8700‚Ç¨ I have just had it past a workshop for a quote / assessment, and they think it will take approx. 3-4 days and cost 1700-1900‚Ç¨ to get it fixed, it doesn't seem worth it to me, for a car that is worth a few times that. I wanted to ask what the long-term consequences are of not getting this professionally fixed? I don't really care that much about the damage itself, but I'm more afraid that it may develop rust or something similar in the future. Is it possible to make a homemade DIY solution, e.g. with a paint pen, spray paint or similar? For me, the dent in the back door is okay since you can't see it and it doesn't affect driving. However, I don't want to be faced with an even bigger bill in a couple of years. How it cosmetically looks doesn't bother me Advice is welcome. :)",

Runs great (for now) other than this new problem of... not starting. I drove about 200 miles to a concert on Wednesday. Went to the concert, came back late at night to the parking garage, car wouldn't turn on. Ignition did nothing - all the dash lights came on as if i was in like 1st position with the key. Computer screens came on, headlights came on, etc. I did not leave my lights on doors open etc while at the concert because I am EXTREMELY paranoid abt dead batteries and I even had my friend with me verify before we left the car. I jumped the car in the garage, all good. Turned back on the next day to drive home. When I got home, had Triple A out to replace the battery. His reader showed me an EXTREMELY low battery. We replaced the battery all fine and good. Car was doing great. Yesterday, after days of having the new battery, the car did the dead thing again. Nothing happened but lights and screens came on. I didn't have time to jump it - I got a ride to work, came back home 8 hours later and tested it - IT STARTED! Turned it off (oops) and ran inside to tell my mom. Came back out to try it again 5 mins later - DEAD. It started from a jump tho thank god. What is happening? Is it a grounding issue? Fusible link? Corroded battery connections? Parasitic battery drain somewhere? I have an appt with the dealership next tuesday but I keep having to randomly jump it when it decides not to turn on. I can't have it in the shop for long because I am going on a trip right after the appt and need the car, so I am hoping it's a quick fix",

I had a similar experience with two vehicles. They would just decide to randomly not start sometimes and then almost randomly trying other times after letting it sit it starts. What is happening is your starter is locking up and unable to turn sometimes and when it happens it draws lots of amps draining your battery fast and not starting the vehicle. also when you say \"Went to the concert, came back late at night to the parking garage, car wouldn't turn on. Ignition did nothing - all the dash lights came on as if i was in like 1st position with the key. Computer screens came on, headlights came on, etc. I\" it sounds like you still have a working battery but your starter is refusing to turn the engine. Sadly because it's a problem that does not always show itself you can't really know for sure till it fails (locks up) and you tow it to a mechanic to test your starter with it locked up. Unless you're mechanically knowledgeable to test this at home. (is ways) What you might want to double check is things that could affect the starter working. Like ground wires, fuses, relays or even loose battery connections. If nothing else is out of place and it happens again I would assume it's your starter based on your descriptions.",

Didn't know it before buying, but apprently the d17 is a very well known for head gasket problems.

The amount of sensors that need programming and calibration on new vehicles, collision repair costs are getting insane, so it‚Äôs no wonder insurance rates are going up. A lot of this stuff is becoming mandated so it‚Äôs only going to get worse as time progresses. New vehicles being designed to use thinner and thinner oils to improve fuel economy at the expense of reliability. 0w-16 oil is now common, that shit is basically water, atf has gone the same way. Think of the bearing clearances required to keep enough oil pressure at idle now. Any wear and there goes your oil pressure! Time for a new motor Basically modern vehicles are shit.",

        "body": "Early to mid 2000 tC, Camry, and Rav4 with the 4 cylinder. The head bolt holes are threaded too deep in the block to adequately catch the head bolts. The head bolts only catch about a 1/4‚Äù of the block threads. Over time and heat cycles, the head bolts pull the few threads they are holding onto out of the block and the head gasket starts leaking coolant. This coolant often ends up in the giant insulator between the block and the intake manifold, so it never falls out of the car. You run out of coolant, the engine overheats, you take it to the dealer, and you get blamed for the head gasket failure, so you get to pay for a head gasket job and the associated machining. There is a TSB that is artfully written to address the problem without actually revealing the manufacturer defect. Toyota had Time-Sert build a kit that fixes the pulled threads in the block by installing inserts *10mm higher in the block* so you can use the same head bolts. If they had offered longer head bolts, they would have tipped their hand, so they have a 14 hour TSB instead. These much higher (and harder) inserts will never let go, so a properly done job should be bulletproof (::looks at job that‚Äôs been holding for 8 years and a hundred thousand miles:: ::knocks on wood::). So yeah, how this never became a class action lawsuit is beyond me. All the evidence is there if anyone had ever wanted to chase it.",

Which one would be more ‚Äúfun‚Äù to drive? A bit more detail - I regularly drive a 2012 Camry and a 2022 Tiguan. The Camry has a 2.5L N/A inline 4 and the Tiguan has the EA888 2L turbo. Both cars have have about 180HP but the Tiguan has 220 tq that peaks down low at 1500RPM, instead of 165 tq at 4800RPM on the Camry. I love the immediate ‚Äúshove‚Äù that the Tiguan produces, but I absolutely HATE how it runs out of steam after about 4500RPM. Everything between that and redline feels so lifeless and bland. In contrast, I love revving out the N/A engine all the way to redline when I‚Äôm driving on backroads but but I feel like passing on the highway is not as effortless because I have to downshift and rev out my engine to make any power. Would my experiences translate directly to 6 cylinder engines or is it different? Would a Turbo I6 have the same ‚Äúrunning out of steam up top‚Äù problem? Would a N/A V6 feel like it needs to put out much more effort to pass on the highway?",

Me and my dad have replaced the spark plugs the spark plug wires, distributor cap, the oil, fuel pump, throttle sensor or something but still no luck trying to start it. The engine sounds fine but then right when it sounds like it's gonna start it just shuts off. When we spray starting fluid into some part (not the biggest car guy but my dad knows) it starts fine and then the starting fluid runs out it sounds like it literally explodes and the car shuts off again. We are thinking it's fuel problems because even after changing the fuel pump to a brand new one we still only hear it when we crank the key rather than just turning the car on. I have videos of trying to start it and shi someone help tho üôè",

This was not happening before engine replacement. Really just trying to find any kind of answers, i took my car back to dealership and of course symptoms wont occur for them so they dismissed me and said car was running fine and sounded good.

You want 50% hot because you want to have the AC compressor constantly running, and warm air coming out the vents which will help the water evaporate off the carpet into the air which will then get sucked back into the evaporator and turned into moisture under the coils and rejected through the condensate drain under the car. You should start seeing tons of water coming out. When you park at night leave the windows cracked. 5 gallons is not a whole lot of water, I've seen worse. keep at it, eventually you'll have it dry. The second option is to rent a dehumidifier from home Depot and put it in there and run the hose out the window, if it'll fit... I don't know if they have one that'll fit those things are pretty big. The final option is to remove the seats and the trim on the floor and pull the carpet kit out and set in the sun for 8 hours. The advantage of this option is you can thoroughly clean your carpet while it's out of the car. source: back in 2008 My mom was bringing some flowers home from the florist for my sister's wedding, I wasn't there when they loaded them because if I was I would have told them to load all of the buckets in the front of the van... but instead they loaded them by the tailgate, well, they got in the freeway and somebody cut them off and guess what happened?? about 20 gallons of water inside her van. was gone in about a week. keep the windows open or you'll have a hell of a time defogging the windows in the morning.",

I‚Äôm really confused about buying a car, my budget is ‚Ç¨13K-15K, on the other hand one of my colleague suggested me to lease a car or use finnAutoAbo. But I‚Äôm a bit skeptical about leased car that when returning don‚Äôt know how much they will charge even for a single scratch. What should I do in this situation?",

Another story from a few years ago. I went downtown to a dispensary to pick up some weed. Its pay to park during the week and you can use a credit card. I parked then as I was going to pay I saw a homeless guy(who I known for a few years - long story short a close friend I know before he went homeless) as we talked I paid for the parking and went to dispensary got what I needed and got in my truck and left. I was at home for maybe 30 mins stone as hell and got a call from an unknown number. I answered and it was a store owner telling me someone found my credit card in the parking meter and turned it into the local store and then they looked me up and got my number and called me. As far as I know I never put my number out on anything and somehow my number is floating around in cyberworld.",

    "selftext": "This morning I started my car normally, drove for 10 mins, then when turning my car off it turned off weird ‚Äî as if it had been unplugged. I tried to turn it on again and it wouldn‚Äôt. No lights, door locks, honk, anything worked. Then it turned on normally 3 mins later. Later in the day I ran errands for over 3 hours. Turned my car off and on multiple times while doing this. No issues. As soon as I made it home and turned it off, it turned off weird again. Again, nothing worked. This time it lasted much longer‚Äî about an hour. Tried jumping my car but it was only enough to get the lights to turn on & my door switches to work but car still didn‚Äôt have enough battery to turn on. As soon as we unhooked it from the other car, battery died. 30 minutes later I went into the car, and now it‚Äôs turning on normally?? no issues starting?? Anyone know what this could be? I‚Äôm still going to switch out the battery since it has warranty & im hoping that‚Äôs the only issue and nothing else that is major.",

I've put the car on jack stands and both front wheels rotate cleanly with no hesitations or sounds. If it were a bearing or warped rotor, I could do the repair myself.

I took it to a local mechanic who diagnosed and fixed the problem. See first attachment for repair description. After picking the car up, I noted that when I put the emergency brake on and had the car in neutral and turned around to buckle my kids in the car started drifting back because the emergency break was not fully engaged. It took both of my arms yanking up at great force to get the emergency break to fully engage. I had called the repair shop about this to get it fixed and had planned to take it in the following week but then a couple days later I was driving and heard a loud pop and thought I blew a tire got out and saw no tire issues. Then when I tried to drive forward, the car wouldn‚Äôt let me drive forward after trying pushing harder on the gas eventually went and then started making a loud clanging noise in the back of the car. The repair shop came and picked the car up and drove it back to their shop and did more repairs which were all done for free. See second repair order picture for reference. I am curious if it is likely that they messed up something on the first repair and caused a problem which led to this second repair. I am not very knowledgeable in cars so I was wondering if anyone couldn‚Äôt enlighten me on if whatever they did the first time would have impacted the issue that arose or if they didn‚Äôt inspect the car well enough and missed this other issue. I feel like they wouldn‚Äôt have done the second repair for free if they had no culpability but don‚Äôt know anything about cars to back up that gut feeling. Thanks so much!!",

I got my car serviced by the dealer the other day, knowing I needed an oil change and my filters (cabin and engine air) changed. I went in with intent to buy the air filters and install it myself. It was fairly busy so I thought I‚Äôd be in there for an hour+ which is typically how long I assume would take. Well, fast forward 20 minutes later, the service person said my car is done. It‚Äôs wet, from their ‚Äúcomplimentary‚Äù car service and the 200+ multipoint check says my engine air and cabin air filters are green and in great shape! I checked the oil and it looked clean on my dip stick. So I‚Äôll give them benefit of the doubt they did in fact do my oil change. To the mechanics: I am fairly turned off by this dealer and will never go back because they clearly don‚Äôt do the services they say (even the bogus multi point check up). I want to find an honest mechanic and not have to worry about if these mechanics actually do the work I paid for. I am at a point I‚Äôd just go find a weekend job to learn at oil lube shops to make money and learn them myself. Please. Any advice?",

Servicing a car doesn‚Äôt really take that long on a lift, and that 200+ point ‚Äúinspection‚Äù is really just more so glancing at everything making sure nothing is detrimentally wrong (ie all your brakes are present, tires aren‚Äôt bald/flat, transmission isn‚Äôt actively dumping fluid, etc.). Most of the time when services take over an hour it‚Äôs because either the service advisor forgot to give someone the job or everyone is busy in that moment. Being done quick doesn‚Äôt always mean they‚Äôre a dishonest shop, most of the time it just means they‚Äôre either slow on work or the technicians are quick with the job. When you service the same 3 cars 14 times a day for a year straight you get pretty quick with the service. Also, the mechanic is rarely the dishonest one in bad shops, typically it‚Äôs bad service writers or bad management who try to coerce you into work that isn‚Äôt exactly necessary to make a quick buck.",

I went to Advanced Auto Parts and got a new one. 2 months later the new one stopped charging so I got replacement under the warranty. I swapped it and this one gave up after a month. I went back to the store complaining about the replacement that it failed again, after talking to manager they honored another replacement. I thought I was good, it was working for about 8 months and today I started again with low charge. Right now I‚Äôm getting little bit over 13.2 V. Do you guys think it‚Äôs my van troubleshooting or the alternators that they sell are crap. At this point I think I should spend extra $$ and get original one that Chevy uses.

Bad fan clutch, lots of bug or stuff in radiator air passages, coolant passages in radiator plugged, water pump with rusted away impeller blades are things that cause overheat on a hill climb.

I still had an old, cheap BT ODBII dongle (10+yo) lying around and downloaded \"Car Scanner\" app. Apparently, it read 198 values and (pretty early on) found P0172 (System too rich, bank 1) and P0101 (Mass air flow (MAF) sensor/volume air flow (VAF) sensor - range/performance problem). This morning, my wife switched ESP off and on and the light is off now. * Would the MAF issue also trigger that light? * The handbrake is a little dodgy and sometimes gets stuck. Could this cause an ESP error? * Wouldn't we expect this to show up in the error codes? * How serious is the MAF issue?

If anything your alternator failed under load because it was already failing. That's what kills cars after doing a jump. Your alternator has already shit the bed, you just don't know it's barely working because all it has to do is maintain a battery. You get one really cold night and that thing was gonna die anyways. That's not a problem with jumping cars. It's a problem with your alternator bud. If I used a truck to tow something well under capacity and 3rd gear spat itself out on the highway would I say the problem is that you were towing as intended by the manufacturer or that your transmission was already half dead? OP, the specific vehicle this is will help us figure out why its doing what it's doing. If it's an 89' Ford f250 it might have two batteries and mechanical injection, which changes the reasons why it might be doing this.

I'm still having issues after the second battery and the shop said they couldn't figure out the issue as the battery tested good and the alternator tested good. But they didn't test it while driving, only idling. So I bought an OBDII scanner and immediately while driving the voltage was reading 12.7-13v, then when I started driving it was dropping down to 11.5ish, then at the lowest 11.2v. immediately to me this read bad alternator. and correct me if im wrong but doing research it seems like the battery was on the verge of dying. Doesn't 13v or less mean the alternator is barely charging if even at all, and around 10.5-11v is where the car starts to lose power? I ordered a remanufactured denso alternator for $135 and planning to replace it myself as the shop quoted me $750 (absolutely insane) for just an alternator replacement.

I was driving it and noticed that it wasn‚Äôt getting over 30-35 with my pedal to the floor. As I pulled into a parking lot, it just shut off. It started up thirty seconds later and drove a little, and died, and started a couple more times, but would die the second I put it into gear and lightly applied the gas. Additionally, we couldn‚Äôt push it into a spot. The brakes were locked up. We could push it just fine two hours later, but not when it first shut off. It started, but only on starting fluid, so I figured it was vapor lock. However, two days later, it wouldn‚Äôt start on starting fluid, and I noticed that it was completely out of coolant & missing the radiator fan relay. Additionally, every time I cranked it, it would leak a little bit of oil on the ground. Otherwise, completely dry. Only when cranking. Fast forward two months, I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs time to fix or sell. Does anyone know what the problem is? My first guess is head gasket, but I don‚Äôt want to dig into doing a head gasket only for the head to be cracked, or for it not to fix the problem. Also, I‚Äôd love for it to be a quicker fix. The other weird thing is that it never smoked and the oil looks normal, not like mayo or peanut butter Finally, yes I‚Äôm an idiot for not checking the coolant repeatedly to see if it was leaking, and not noticing that the relay was missing, and for a million other things I‚Äôm sure.

    "selftext": "Hi all, about two months ago (March 22, 2025), I was driving on a gravel/rocky road at relatively low speeds (\\~8-15mph). As I was driving on this road, I heard what appeared to be some small rocks getting flung up against the car's bottom. This would lead to the splash shield (Honda part number [74110-TR3-A10](https://www.hondafactoryparts.com/oem-parts/honda-under-cover-74110tr3a10)), which was already somewhat damaged, to become even more damaged, to the point that a part of it was now scraping the ground when driving in certain conditions. I ended up cutting the part of the damaged shield that was scaping against the ground. Additionally, there's now this rattling sound that can be heard when driving. I [linked a recording](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6k9tR0m7wAg) of the rattling from my most recent drive; the rattling starts around 10 seconds in. This rattling sound is barely audible when driving on flat (\"good\") roads, and it's basically a non-issue when driving at fast speeds. However, the rattling sound becomes more audible when driving on more rough (\"bad\") roads, such as roads with bumps. The recording here is me driving on a road where there's a fair amount of very small potholes and small rocks here and there. Another interesting thing to note is that, when I cold start the car while the air conditioner was on, \\*occasionally\\* there is a loud, very noticeable rattling sound, that occurs for about 15 seconds. This just sounds like a much louder, more continuous version of this audio clip here. This only happens on a cold start and when the A/C is on. If the car is in operating temperatures and the A/C is on, that rattling sound isn't audible. As of recently, this seems to be happening less and less. The A/C still works just fine. ***I should emphasize that, prior to March 22, I never heard any rattling sounds like in this audio clip.*** My first suspicion is that the old splash shield became loose/damaged thus causing the rattling noise. So, about a month after the incident, I purchased an aftermarket splash shield and replaced the damaged splash shield with the new splash shield. This did not fix the rattling noise. I took the car to the dealership for an inspection, where they told me the car was actually involved a prior collision that I wasn't aware of. They refused to do any further inspection, telling me that the car should go to an auto body shop to get fixed up, and that there could be many different reasons for the rattling sound. For what it's worth, the previous owner -- my dad -- was actually involved in a very minor collision, and he got the car fixed up at the local auto body shop. Nonetheless, the rattling sound is only a recent issue, so I don't think the prior collision would have caused this. Anyways, today, I spent a few hours trying to figure out why the rattling sound is happening. * I took the splash shield off, thinking maybe I installed it incorrectly, and took the car for a drive with no shield. The rattling sounds did not go away. * While the splash shield was off, I spent a little bit of time trying to see if there were any loose/unstable parts. The only part I found that was pretty loose was the front engine splash shield (I believe the Honda part number is [74111-TR3-A00](https://www.hondafactoryparts.com/oem-parts/honda-2012-2015-honda-civic-shield-front-splash-74111tr3a00)). I didn't check this too carefully, just merely looked around at anything the rocks might have hit. * I also looked around to see if there were any rocks or other debris that might be causing the rattling sounds. I did find what appeared to be a broken push pin stuck between that shield and the car, although this didn't get rid of the rattling. * I also inspected the engine bay to see if there were any loose parts. I don't think there were any. Anyways, I'm unsure where else to look for. Given that there could probably be a billion different reasons for the rattling, I suspect I might need to take this car in for another inspection at an independent mechanic, so that'll be my next plan. That being said, I guess my questions are: * Given that the car drives fine (no other unknown issues and, aside from the rattling, **driving the car feels and sounds the same before and after the incident**), is this something to be concerned about? Right now, this is more of an annoyance than anything else, but I don't know if this is something to be more concerned about. * Do you guys have any other ideas of where I should check? Thanks in advance for any advice given!",

I don't believe (also hope) that it is a head gasket issue because: \\- no drop in coolant observed for 6+ months \\- no check engine light \\- no engine overheating \\- no \"milky\" oil on my dipstick \\- no sweet smell to the smoke (it does smell like gas tho) \\- I''ve tried the head gasket tester kit and it came back negative \\- only happens if the car sits for a few hours ive also been told my fuel economy is below what it should be with it averaging around 19/20 city driving. I also notice that switching my car from park to drive makes the white smoke stop faster. I swapped out my fuel injectors and the issue still persists, and my throttle body seems fine as well so neither of those. My mass airflow sensor is also clean so probably not that. Sometimes the engine (when either parked or not moving while in drive) will feel like it spins up/down. I am a bit at a loss for what it could be any adivce?",

    "selftext": "I have a 2019 Audi RS3 on a Stage 2 tune that‚Äôs been having performance issues. It‚Äôs only hitting around 75% boost. When I go full throttle at higher speeds, the car throws a ‚ÄúDrive System Malfunction‚Äù message and enters limp mode. I‚Äôm also getting a check engine light with code P0299 (Turbo/Supercharger Underboost). i‚Äôm getting poor fuel economy, rough idle, and exhaust smoke. So far, I‚Äôve replaced the Engine coolant temperature sensor and Ambient air temperature sensor. This didn‚Äôt solve the issue. On top of that, I ran a smoke test on the intake system and didn‚Äôt find any leaks. I‚Äôm now suspecting a failing boost pressure sensor, but i‚Äôm stuck at this point. please anyone with help / input / answers. Thanks.",

    "selftext": "Today I sold the first car I ever had, a Volkswagen Beetle. I got her in high school, and she lasted with me all the way through college. She was old and slow, and as my mom always says, I should‚Äôve broken down a long time ago. But I truly believe she had a spirit or some sort of guardian angel looking out for me. She never got into an accident, never broke down‚Äîshe just kept running, just for me. Unfortunately, her engine was a mess, and fixing it would‚Äôve been too much. I needed a safer, more reliable vehicle, so I had to say goodbye. I'm heartbroken and have been crying all day. But the person I sold her to owns an auto shop and plans to fix her up for his daughter, so I guess she‚Äôll live on in a way. It‚Äôs hard to let go of the car that protected me for five years, the one that saw me through high school and college. She wasn‚Äôt just a car to me; she was a companion. If you have any heartwarming stories about your first car, I‚Äôd love to hear them. I could really use something to brighten my day.",

I would say my usage of it has been very light compared to what it had gone through, and i've done regular maintenance on it. Before being sold to me it had been at over 125k, had been in collisions, and a lot of structural damage. I put about 40k on it in the last 5 years and a good amount of money to repair it including replacing the whole axel. However it is due for numerous general repairs, as well as some other more costly repairs totaling up to 3k based on a recent estimate. The doors are having electrical and mechanical issues and it's really annoying to open. tpms sensors need to be replaced. The tires are starting to bald. The muffler is almost completely rusted out. the blower motor needs to be replaced. The strut assembly needs to be replaced. Engine and transmission mount needs to be replaced. Brakes are okay but worn out. I'm also up for reupping my insurance and other bills, and am facing a layoff at work, so this is not ideal. Right now the engine seems okay and it starts up fine, tho sometimes it has a weird laggy stalling feeling when i brake and press on gas. i'm anxious that it will cost more to fix it up than it is worth especially if it is on it's last legs. is this car at the end of its life? It would be hard to not have a car right now but i also don't want to flush money down the toilet if it seems like she might give out. Appreciate any advice you guys have.",

We looked at the receipts and it appeared in order and they just got me a new tire. Fast forward 3 months I get stabbed again from a different tire. I go in pissed because this store manages all our vehicle tires. Long story short Cooper radial makes a LT tire and an non LT tire that looks the same and have the same name or close. I had the non LT tire. All we could figure is the steel belts wete literally snapping inside the rubber and working free from heat in combination with the centripedal force.

I don't like the rims and wanna replace them with something black but that size just doesn't seem super popular/have a lot of options. Is there an issue swapping to 20x10.5 or 20x11 for all of them? Also when looking at some rims the 20x11 say Rear only. Does that mean I can't throw them on the front wheels since they're the same size as what I have now? What makes them \"Rear only\"",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I recently changed the transmission fluid on my 2010 Toyota Camry myself, and I've run into an issue. I'm now noticing a noise and a slight shake when shifting into Reverse (R) and Drive (D), particularly when the car is first started and during parking maneuvers. The noise and vibration seem a bit more pronounced when shifting into R. These symptoms are not very loud or violent, so they can be hard to detect once I'm driving normally. However, they definitely exist, at least for the first few minutes of driving. Interestingly, sometimes after driving for a bit (e.g., a 3miles trip to Walmart), the noise and shaking will disappear when shifting into D. Both the noise and shake in R and D seem to go away completely after a longer drive Ôºàaround 10miles on the highwayÔºâ. Before the fluid change, I did occasionally experience a similar, but much milder, noise and shake in R. This would usually disappear as soon as the car started moving or after about 10seconds. Now, the symptoms are more persistent and harder for them to disappear. **Regarding driving performance:** There isn't a huge difference when driving, though **the shifts** ***might*** **feel slightly less smooth.** However, this is very subtle and not easily noticeable. There's no noticeable loss of power. I also haven't experienced a situation where the RPMs increase during acceleration, but the car's speed doesn't change, which might indicate slipping. Unfortunately, my OBD2 scanner can't read current gear information, so I don't know exactly when it's shifting. **Key details:** * **Car:** 2010 Toyota Camry * **Work Done:** DIY transmission fluid change. * **Symptoms:** Noise and shaking when shifting into R and D; possibly slightly less smooth shifts. * **When it Happens:** Noise/shaking most noticeable when the car is cold or has been sitting. Worse in R. * **When it Improves/Disappears:** Noise/shaking sometimes improves for D after a short drive. Both R and D symptoms seem to resolve after a longer drive (fully warmed up). * **Comparison to Before:** Similar noise/shake issue existed mildly in R before, but is now more pronounced and persistent after the fluid change. **My questions:** 1. Has anyone experienced similar issues after a transmission fluid change on this generation of Camry (or similar Toyotas)? 2. What could be the potential causes? I'm wondering about: * Incorrect fluid level (too high or too low)? I know these can be tricky without a dipstick. * Wrong type of transmission fluid? (I can provide details on what I used if helpful). * Air trapped in the system? * Did the fluid change perhaps highlight an existing issue? 3. What steps would you recommend for troubleshooting this? For example, how critical is the exact fluid level checking procedure (temperature, etc.)? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance. I consulted a mechanic, who was recommended by a friend, about this issue. However, he seemed unhappy that I changed the transmission fluid. He believes that you should never change the transmission fluid on an old car and that doing so will inevitably cause the transmission to fail. I also have a video recording where you can hear the noise. In the recording, I shift from Park (P) to Reverse (R) at approximately the 5-second mark. If you look at the opened car door in the video, you might be able to notice the shake as well.",

I have had Lucy for about 3 years now and she has done me incredibly well for my first car. My parents are wanting me to trade her In for something a bit newer (not now but in the future) and I'm really not sure what to do, because I'm not a massive car person but I do like to tinker from time to time and I have a few plans for her if I do decide to keep her. I would like to get the paint redone and maybe some coilovers and some new rims and a whole bunch of other stuff... like a muffler delete ü§§ but I'm not sure with the age of lucy would it be worth doing it. I would hate for her to cross over the 300,000 kilometers mark (currently about 245,000) and then the engine crap out or something that sorta forces my hand. If I do replace lucy it would deffently be a mazda again but I have this feeling that if I was to replace her it would be a big mistake because I see alot of Mazda 3's on the road but not the SP23 variant. And I feel when I done with her she would be really unique which is sorta my dream car im not really a big fancy sports car kinda guy. But on the other hand she is starting to get to the age were massive work needs to be done on her, like she needs some new control arms cause the bushings are starting to go in the rear, a couple belts need to be replaced cause there starting to squeal like a stuck pig. I see the points my parents are making but at the same time...... that's my baby ü•∫ Idk, feel free to comment what you think any advice welcome just need some outside opinions.",

        "body": "Does it still go into park? Any oil leaking from underneath the car? ü§≠ The parking pawl in a grannymatic gearbox is not overly robust, especially its pivot, and it can easily break. This is why people who don't use hand brakes and instead rely on leaving a car in park are complete morons. When you put the car in park, in most gearboxes a spring loaded plunger pushes on the park pawl, when the park gear is in a suitable location, the plunger can travel it's full distance and push the pawl into one of the gaps on the gear. The plunger now takes any outward force and transfers this to the gearbox case. The sideways force is taken by the pawl and its pivot point. Hence you can literally blow a hole in the case. You can also break the pawl, or a piece of it, and this will then cause mechanical mayhem at some undetermined time later. Usually people are lucky and the pawl will not engage with a moving gear and instead skips along the teeth leading to a horrible noise. Occasionally tho, the outcome isn't that great. If there are options for internal access (depending on what car/ gearbox, i would recommend pulling output speed sensor, or something in the vicinity of the park gear and utilising a borescope camera for an internal investigation. Mainly because you heard a strange noise afterwards... Edit: just saw your video. If that is not road/suspension noise, and wasn't their prior, I would recommend not driving it any further, putting it on a tilt tray and taking it to a mechanic.",

    "selftext": "This is on a tractor not a car, but I'm thinking the mechanical knowledge would be relatively the same for the problem we are having. On our tractor the return hydraulic line for the power steering has a pinhole in it. The line goes from the steering column back to the top of the hydraulic filter. To replace the line the cab of the tractor has to be removed to disconnect the ends of the lines. Does anyone have any ideas of ways to try and seal the pinhole? It is a hard line, not a flexible line.",

Toyota doesn't sell or manufacture them and there aren't any aftermarket, only option is to buy a $800 OEM rack or find one at a salvage yard. Once I located the pinhole leak I drained out as much power steering fluid as I could and cleaned the area with brake cleaner. I then got my MIG welder and put 2 or 3 tack welds on the area with the hole. It's been holding up for 2 years so far.",

Seemed fine for a few days drove it every day, one day it was slow turning over then it sped up and started in a matter of a few seconds. Then today when it was dead dead. Couldn't unlock my doors with the fob. When I put my key in the ignition, the windshield wipers came on when nothing else did and the stick was in the off position. Key was locked into the ignition as well. Jumped it and it drove me to work. Went to start it on my lunch break (4 hours of being off) and again it's dead dead. Also while I drove it, the radio turned completely off randomly. Didn't hit a bump or anything. Screen went totally black. Gonna get it checked tomorrow but, wondering if there's any suggestions what it might be? My guess is wiring but, it's been rolling around in my head all day. 2015 chevy malibu if it matters.",

If still nothing then back to 3 bars and spray it with soapy water all over and wait a bit to see if there are tiny bubbles stacking up somewhere over a longer period of time. If still nothing then I just take the tire off, inspect the inside, replace the valve, clean the rim and the tire where they connect to each other and put it all back together and on the car to test if that solved anything. Usually after all this the issue is gonna even if I don't know what caused the leak but if not then that is most likely some manufacturing issue or something that will not show up unless the wheel is on the car.

    "selftext": "Hey there, first post here. I own a 2012 Audi A8 D4 without any of the pre sense stuff and would like to know if it would be possible to fit only a Collision avoidance system to it or not. I'm not even looking for one that would make the cruise control adaptive (although if it did I wouldn't be mad). I remember hearing about a brand that sold ones which you'd put on your dashboard and they'd calculate the distance through the windshield but never got one or heard about them in recent years. Any info would be greatly appreciated. P.s. I'm posting this here instead of in the Audi SUV because there are more people and usually with better answers.",

I logged my vehicle speed and engine RPM. My thinking was, if I calculate `speed / RPM`, I should be able to see which gear the car is in, right? Like, I'd expect to see 6 distinct, relatively straight lines on a plot, each representing a different gear ratio. But when I plotted it out, it's... well, a bit of a Jackson Pollock. There's no super clear pattern of 6 distinct levels. I get that there are 6 gears, so there should theoretically be 6 main \"rates,\" but my data isn't showing that cleanly. What gives? Is my understanding of how an AT works flawed, or is something else going on?",

Now, they‚Äôve finally replaced the radio, and my miles are still down at 15k. They are trying to tell me that that is the correct mileage because that‚Äôs what the computer is reading.

So far I have tinted my back windows, tuned it to stage 1 for a few more horses and better gas milage, minor interior changes like wooden shifter to match the wooden trim, new plates and badges for a fresh look and most recently got new rims, spacers coming soon. The question, should I do anything more? I like to style it, it's fun, but also expensive and I don't want to overdo it in any way at all. The thought of a m-sport bumper or downpipe has struck me, but it's pricey and turns it into a generic \"bmw build\". The plan is to do a swirl-flap delete this summer to prevent any unwanted accidents, check some vacuum tubes for leaks as I experience some minor problems with acceleration on the 3rd gear and get new brakes as these ones are a bit dated. I'll add some pictures, grateful for any advice or opinion",

I have physically looked at some of them and they indeed appear brand new. I have also weighed a few and the weight matches the odyssey specs. I don't believe they are counterfeit. Which leads me to my question. Where are all of these (hundreds for sale in so cal) batteries coming from? There are numerous different sellers on marketplace.",

Requires a fairly intensive teardown to replace. If you can't do that yourself, then you probably don't want an rx8. Also I happen to have an 8th Gen Si right now. My second one, as a matter of fact. I'm not going to tell you they're fast, because they're not. But what Honda does a fantastic job of is making a slow car *feel* fast. And they're bulletproof when it comes to reliability. My one complaint is fuel economy. I experience 20-25mpg now that I'm in my 30s. But when I had my first one in my 20s I was getting like 15mpg. If you drive very conservatively you can break 30mpg.",

    "selftext": "Tldr at the end, sorry for the long post Last year my Aunt gifted me her old car to help me out of a tough spot, and I'm incredibly grateful for it. It's older than I am, but it has been very well maintained, and had less than 100k miles on it when I got it. That being said, this is an old car and it is not without many quirks and challenges. I've learned a lot about cars and fixing them since I got it, with the help of my dad (he was a big car guy before he had kids) Right from the get go I noticed an alarming problem where my car would start to creep forward when I was at a stop, and the resistance on my brake pedal would slowly decrease. The creeping would decrease if I put on the emergency brake and pumped the pedal, and the resistance would return for a few minutes. Talked to my dad, and he said this is obviously an issue with the hydrolics, and he taught me how to bleed the breaks. It helped but didn't fix the problem entirely. I googled the problem and found a forum post from eons past that went over my head saying it had something to do with the drum brake and the emergency brake. My dad kind of scoffed at me about it (for some reason he thinks finding answers on the internet is only valid when he does it, haha) but he had his mechanic come look at it. His mechanic rebuilt (???) the drum brake? I have no idea how that works, but the mechanic said the previous guy who worked on it put something together wrong. He also said the hydrolic lines looked fine and we had bled the breaks correctly. These things also helped a lot, but the problem persisted, specifically when the weather is warm. At this point I think my dad has gotten a little defensive (and has a bit of stung pride), because he's tried his best to help me fix it yet the problem hasn't gone away. He has been telling me that there is no earthly reason the car would keep doing this specifically when the weather warms up. I know correlation does not equal causation, but I've driven this car like 30-40 miles a day for the past year and this is the only correlation I can make. I will definitely admit I have very little experience with cars though, so I am open to being wrong about this. Mostly I feel like I'm going a little crazy. Help me Car Talk - you're my only hope. TLDR- The issue: -Car creeps forward while pressing the brake pedal. -Brake pedal loses resistance until I am pushing it to the floor. -Pumping the brakes helps ease the issue for long enough to stay stopped safely at an intersection. - I've noticed (perhaps incorrectly) that this gets worse when the weather is warm. The fixes we've tried that have somewhat helped: -bled the brake line -Mechanic rebuilt (I have no idea what that means) the drum brake. The questions: -is there something I am not noticing because I don't have car experience that I should be paying attention to? -Does anyone have any idea why the fixes we've done have helped, but not fixed the issue? -Wtf is wrong with the brakes?",

HOWEVER, there is no sticker whatsoever stating when the timing belt was last replaced nor any mention of it in the booklet. I'm nervous to drive with it because i know from experience the timing belt doesnt give you a warning; if it breaks, it breaks and it will take the engine down with it. And looking at the current kms on it, its due soon or had to already have been done. (According to the manual it should be done every 10y or every 120-150k km) Money isn't the issue, but any mechanic i call can't fit me in until later next week.

Action taken: * Parked checked the oil level - level a bit high but OK. * Started the car - light still on * Revved the engine lightly - light turned off then turned back on on idle * Revved the engine strongly - light turned off and stayed off (for the whole duration of drive to garage and at garage for multiple startups) * Checked with OBD code reader - no errors shown * Got the oil & filter changed - light still off * 30 min test drive - small flicker whilst going into gear 1 from idle * Tested idle and startups - half of the idle-to-1st gear the light would come up for <1s; half of the startups the light would be on until car is revved. The light never stays on for more than a second (except on startup when it stays until first revved). It doesn‚Äôt seem to come any longer while driving. I‚Äôm wondering if this is something I can monitor or if I should avoid longer drives (say 300 miles) until it‚Äôs diagnosed. Any advice appreciated!",

    "selftext": "Hello. A friend has a 2010 Chevy Traverse and while going to work it died. Towed home, connected the code reader and the following 5 codes popped up. I only know a few things, but given the timing chain was mentioned I thought it would be better to ask around before firing off the Parts Cannon. Any information on what this might be would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Code 2635: The P2635 code in a Chevy Traverse indicates a problem with the fuel pump \"A\" flow performance, meaning the fuel pump isn't delivering the correct fuel pressure. This code typically means the check engine light is on and you may experience engine-related issues like poor performance, trouble starting, or misfires. Common causes include a failing fuel pump, a faulty fuel pump control module, or wiring problems. Code 0336: The P0336 DTC in a Traverse indicates a crankshaft position sensor circuit problem, specifically a \"Range/Performance\" issue. This means the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is receiving a signal from the crankshaft position sensor that's outside of its expected parameters. Possible causes include a faulty sensor, a damaged reluctor ring, or wiring issues. Code P0420: A P0420 code on a Chevy Traverse indicates a catalyst system efficiency below threshold, meaning the catalytic converter is not working efficiently enough to reduce emissions. This could be caused by a variety of issues, including a failing catalytic converter, exhaust leaks, faulty oxygen sensors, or even engine problems. Code P0087: A P0087 code on a Chevy Traverse indicates that the fuel rail pressure is too low. This means the engine isn't receiving enough fuel to run properly, potentially causing issues like stalling, poor performance, or increased fuel consumption. The code is triggered when the vehicle's engine computer (PCM) detects a drop in fuel rail pressure. Code P0430: The P0430 code on a Chevy Traverse indicates that the catalytic converter on Bank 2 is not functioning efficiently, meaning it's not cleaning the exhaust gases properly. This code can be triggered by various factors, including a faulty catalytic converter, exhaust leaks, or issues with the oxygen sensors. Code P0008: Code P0008 in a Chevy Traverse indicates an issue with the engine's position system, specifically misalignment of the crankshaft and camshaft on bank 1. This often points to a problem with the timing chain or tensioner, causing improper timing and engine performance issues. (I went and looked at the vehicle. It cranks fine, all the belts are intact, gas isn't bad, thinking it might be the fuel pumps or a clogged up catalytic converter. Thoughts!? Thanks.)",

Nothing preventing them from selling you a fried CPU that they bent the pins to make it seem like an easy repair will do it. In this case, car could be running in limp mode for a variety of reasons and I'm unsure it'd go on limp mode just because of an EGR delete, more likely would idle roughly but doubt with major issues. You may very well buy the car, tune it, and find out something else is very wrong. EDIT: So I didn't read correctly or whatever it can definitely go on limp mode on downpipe replacement. So it's plausible especially what he said about the ignition resetting the limp mode, likely sensors stuff. So yeah, might be an easy fix for someone who knows, but I'm not very informed on tunning and modifications, might as well go with a mechanic cause even if you work on your own cars, I wouldn't do the tune at home, especially if I've not confirmed if that's the issue or not. You're gonna need someone to work on it so let them see for themselves",

It has been happening more often recently, so I plan to replace it soon. However, in the last two weeks, when trying to start the car, there has been no sound at all. I tried several times and got nothing. With the faulty starter, it would usually make a sound when trying to kick in, even if the engine did not start. After checking further, I noticed the 30A ignition fuse had blown. I replaced it, but it blew again a few days later. Then again today. I am assuming that as the starter motor has got worse, it is drawing more current and causing the fuse to blow. Just checking if I am thinking along the right lines, because the last thing I want is to put in a new starter motor and then find out the fuse issue is unrelated.",

Numerous technicians looked this car over and I didn't even see a dab of grease on these caliper pins. I didn't have any on hand so I put on copper grease for the week or so until new pins arrived and then swapped out the whole pin setup (including the rubber) for fresh brembo pins and sillicone grease.

This makes no sense being a fuel injected car. If I don‚Äôt pump the gas when the split second attempt at firing happens, I‚Äôve lost my window and have to wait for it to cool completely. One of my cylinders had a misfire due to a bad head, so the mechanic put a new head on it a few months ago. Not sure if that‚Äôs related. It always had a long crank before the head replacement but would start when warm. Now I don‚Äôt have the misfire anymore, but can‚Äôt start the car when warm. Any ideas?",

    "selftext": "So, I have a 1995 Chrysler LeBaron that I‚Äôve been working on restoring and fixing up. Everything has been going smoothly except for the issue with the fuel gauge, which is very very odd. The fuel pump and sending unit on these cars are 2 separate units instead of how the newer cars have them together. When I dropped the tank to clean the old gas out, the float for the old sending unit was just‚Ä¶floating around in there. So I got a new one and put it in. Only issue, it also doesn‚Äôt work very much. It will be stuck at 1 level only. Full or 3/4 of a tank. Naturally, I thought the thing was defective, so I took it out of the tank and moved the float manually while I had someone watch the gauge. Of course, it functioned as normal. Went to full, all the way back to empty, so I think that ruled out the gauge and the sending unit. Next, I thought it was getting stuck, so I dropped the tank again and checked it through the filler neck hole. I can put a long extension down in there and move the float real easy, so that couldn‚Äôt be it either and I‚Äôm honestly stuck on what to do. Any ideas? I‚Äôm going to college for being a mechanic and even the teacher hasn‚Äôt run into this issue.",

My mechanic is now telling me that I need a new idle air control valve and a new gasket for the metal housing. I KNOW OEM IS RECOMMENDED, but its just not possible, I've searched for hours and they are discontinued from Mitsubishi. I was wondering has anyone ever bought an aftermarket idle air control valve and it actually worked and worked for a couple of years at least or is it like 100% guaranteed to fail in the first year? I keep finding post that say they fail in a year so go OEM, but some people like me don't have that option.

You also should replace the filter at least once. Once again though, draining the fluid is BENEFICIAL. Transmissions failing afterwards, is purely coincidental and usually a result of people waiting until it started making a bad sound or shifting weird to change their fluid.",

    "selftext": "Hello Everyone, For the past several months My 2009 Hyundai Elantra(2.0 L 4 cylinder) had a slight jerk every so often-- it would usually happen after 15-20mins of driving while going 35-45, and I'd mainly feel it when I'd accelerate and/or ease my foot off of the gas pedal. It would only jerk once. I took it to a repair shop back in November for diagnostics, but the mechanic was not able to replicate the problem after he fixed the other problems with my car(glazed belt; and changed the oil, transmission fluid change, and air filter), so he did not know what was wrong and told me I should not worry about it especially with the oil and transmission fluid change because it would be running better. While it did run better overall, the occasional jerk persisted. Forward to today on my way to the store, my car jerked three times in a row/all at once as opposed to the usual one jerk. On my way home, it did it again, but mutiple times, and I noticed it would do it when I'd accelerate. I was at two red lights, and each time, while stopped with my foot on the brake, it jerked once. I'm not sure what the problem could be. Any ideas? And is there a sure way to know what exactly the problem is? Also, with the weekend coming up I'm not sure if I would be able to get it fixed in time for my upcoming appointments on Monday and Tuesday. Monday I am going to be driving a total of 15 miles, and Tuesday 9 miles-- is it safe to do so? Would Id likely be able to make it home and back each day?",

We pushed it off longer than we probably should have. Popping sound when turning the wheel and popping when hit a small bump while driving. Fast forward to a few weeks ago we finally take the can to the dealership mechanic we got it from. 2019 odyssey touring with 58k miles now. They say the bushings are bad and need replaced. They make a note stating the tires are larger than what‚Äôs recommended from the manufacturer. We didn‚Äôt notice the note. Last week, we took the van back because it sounded and felt like the bushings were bad already. They make us aware that the tires are too large causing it to strike the wheel well. He said it can be the cause of the bushings going bad this soon. He made it seem unusual that they went bad at 50k miles. The manufacturer recommends 235R and the tire shop put on 265R. I took it back to the tire shop today. They owned the mistake and are willing to replace the tires at no charge. I pushed for a $1,300 reimbursement for the bushings based on what the mechanic told me and what I‚Äôm reading online. Does anyone have experience with this or is there anything anyone can recommend to help me? Or is pursuing reimbursement for the bushings a pipe dream?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, just a question about this noise my wheel seems to make when going slower. It doesn‚Äôt happen all the time, but it‚Äôs VERY noticeable when it does happen (usually starts on the highway). Since it doesn‚Äôt happen all the time, I was thinking it may be related to another issue with the car starting to shake when going around 70mph. Like the noise issue, this doesn‚Äôt happen all the time ‚Äî only at certain points during travel. It will usually stop after a little while. Anyone know what the cause of these issues may be?",

The mechanic said he could fix it in two ways one being $1400 that required a new run of lines and assembly from the dealer or he could for $150 simply loop that heater coil out, and I would only have heating in the front and the air conditioning would be intact. I picked up the van. Everything worked as stated it wasn‚Äôt overheating when I left work today my power steering went out I can clearly see fluid dripping out. How did this happen?

This model, AFAIK, doesn‚Äôt have a separate serpentine belt tensioner, so there‚Äôs a screw attached to the alternator that pulls the belt tight. When I installed, I had to tighten the screw to a greater degree than how it was before (as you can see in the pic where the clean part where it was set before is quite different than where I had it set now). I double and triple checked the serpentine belt‚Äôs arrangement thru the pulleys, saw it was correct to the best of my judgement based on online diagrams and the photos I took before. I figured it was something particular about that serpentine belt, but yesterday noticed a squeal after starting the car when it‚Äôs been sitting overnight (50s, not too cold). Any ideas? Time to get another belt, or did I put it thru the pulleys wrong?",

The sympthom: Cold engine, car starts just fine Warm engine, car starts just fine Half warm/cool engine the car struggles to start, crank really fast, rpms slowly reach idle. I've changed all the slark plugs (8), did an oil change, new battery, compression test, and checked live data and everything was okey. I checked valve clearance, it was okey, didn't need a change. I went to the mechanic with the car. The mechanic also have no clue what could be wrong but he suspects two things: Either one or more injector are faulty and leaking fuel into the combustion chamber. Or the AC is faulty, and the fuel pressure regulator is broken. The mechanic also noticed a clear smell of petrol when the car starts, which is abnormal. The idle is good, pulls great, doesnt eat oil, so the engine is in a good shape but we cannot find the route of the problem. Can you guys help please? #HONDA",

Typically all of those lights are related with the wheel speed sensor, however if the battery was disconnected that could also trigger them and you just need to drive the vehicle above a certain speed to clear them. First thing is see what codes you have, OBD2 scanners are between $20-$50, or take it to autozone and they will scan it for free. Without a scan, you could‚Ä¶. If it is wheel speed sensor and not a battery issue, inspect the abs sensor wires going to each wheel if they look good, maybe pull out the speed sensor and clean the tip. While you have the wheel in the air, wiggle it around, if the bearing is bad it can set off those errors as well since the air gap on the speed sensor will be wrong. Good luck.",

    "selftext": "Looking at this 2001 Subaru Outback ¬∑ 2.5i Basic Wagon 4D. Only concern I have is it says It got a new ej20 engine in it with 73k miles on it and they couldnt roll the odometer back. And the chassis has 284k miles. Is that gonna be an issue for me or affect anything I need to worry about? Other concerns are passenger wiper dont work and tag lights dont work. Easy fixs I can do. They said they replaced the insturment cluster cause it says the car running hot but isnt, so also any idea on what to do after that? üòÇ",

    "selftext": "**2006 Mitsubishi Lancer ES, 61,000 Miles** Long story short my car idling really low at around 400 - 500 rpm triggering a check engine light. This happened when I was randomly trying to park my car 2 weeks ago. My car also would sometime not start right away and you have to hold the gas pedal to keep it from dying until it can idle, but would still idle low. I took my car over to my mechanic and he discovered that coolant was seeping through from one area of the throttle body into the area where the idle air control valve is located ( its not leaking from the outside in). He thinks this is the issue so he just did a coolant throttle body bypass because coolant is not needed in the throttle body where I live. Anyways after the coolant bypass the car does start and maintains idle at 700 - 800 rpm, but when you turn on the AC the idle drops to around 600 rpm and stays at 600 rpm. Then when you turn on the radio and fan and it drops to below 500 rpm triggering the check engine light. The car is not compensating for the additional load and raising the rpm like it should. Right now I think its either the coolant shorting out the idle air control valve so I just need to buy a new one or worst is that the coolant shorted out the idle air control valve which then screwed up the ECU. I read on a forum about this happening to people with Nissan Pathfinders. The same exact situation in which coolant seeped onto the idle air control valve and then over time that shorts out the idle air control valve which then causes a fuse to blow and destroy a capacitor or chip on the ECU. If my ECU did get shorted out by the idle air control valve shorting out from the coolant would my car still be able to start and run, but idle weird or would it not be able to start at all?",

They would first see if they can get reading through the OBD, and probe the output of the idle control valve with a multimeter or osciliscope to see if it correlates with what the ECU says. Finally, they would test the voltage at the sensor and the wiring between the sensor and ECU for any issues.",

    "selftext": "So I started driving in 2022 and learned on an 8th gen Honda Accord. I‚Äôm 6'3\", long-legged, and pretty much all my driving since has been in sedans. mostly the Accord and a W212 E-Class. Both of those cars just fit me. I like a low, knees slightly bent seating position with arms at a comfortable 120‚Äì130 degrees. Everything feels natural, and I can slip into that ‚Äúflow state‚Äù on long drives without thinking about it. Now, here‚Äôs the problem: My dad has a 2023 (pre-refresh) Skoda Kodiaq, and we‚Äôre about to take it on a Delhi‚ÄìLadakh road trip(3500 kms). We‚Äôll be splitting driving duties, 6to 8 hours of mountain roads every day, and despite having driven the car a decent bit, I just cannot get comfortable in it. I‚Äôve spent hours trying every possible seating combo: Tried every seat height from lowest to highest Recline is fairly upright (my preference) Steering wheel is fully extended, and I still feel like I‚Äôm stretching when my legs are comfy If I move closer to fix that, my calves feel like they‚Äôre under constant tension when on the pedals. The end result? I feel like I‚Äôm either cramping my legs or overextending my arms. I‚Äôve never had this issue in the Accord or the E-Class. Then there‚Äôs the visibility. Everyone raves about how SUVs give you a better view, but I feel less in control. I can‚Äôt confidently place the car, especially the front corners and rear thirds. I have no idea where the nose ends, and the rear-side visibility is just awkward. No flow state, no connection, just constant mental stress . For mountains driving in sports mode helps with body roll and allows a bit of engine braking which I like, but the throttle is way too sensitive even in Normal. Eco mode smooths it out a bit, but then I don‚Äôt have the power I need for overtakes in the hills, even with my foot buried. The problem is with the first 1/4th of the pedal where It jerks a decent bit and I don't have a good foot position on the pedal to get on it really smoothly like I can in the accord(also sensitive pedal). For context, I wear either my regular new balance shoes or puma motorsport driving shoes, same as what I use in the other 2 cars. Also, bonus frustration: I can‚Äôt play my usual music with my dad in the car, which really helps me focus while driving. That‚Äôs minor, but when everything else feels off, it adds up. Taking one of the other cars isn't an option as the accord has served its time and is going to be scrapped in a few days(in major Indian cities you can't have a petrol car registered for more than 15 years) and the E class doesn't have the ground clearance for some of the routes we are planning to go to. TLDR: Tall, long-legged driver used to low-slung sedans now has to drive an SUV (Kodiaq) on a big mountain trip. Seat/steering adjustments leave me uncomfortable no matter what. Visibility and throttle are frustrating. I want to enjoy this drive, but right now the car feels like it‚Äôs working against me. Any other tall drivers gone through this? Is this just an SUV thing? Is there a trick to adjusting posture in crossovers? Or do I just need to get used to it and stop overthinking? I really want a solution to this I'm just so fucking tired.",

My thought is, raise the top, caulk the entire inside, put it back down to let it set. Then also apply it on the outside where it comes down to attempt to fully prevent water from entering. This would render the convertible top basically useless, but I don‚Äôt really mind that. So, would this be a bad idea? Are there any potential repercussions I‚Äôm not considering that could have an adverse effect?",

Honestly, I built this with my family in mind (they still rent out cars back home), but I figured others might find it helpful too. If you‚Äôve got your own rental hustle, maybe give it a shot? üÜì 100% Free, No ads, No upsell ‚Äî just something I needed, so I made it.

I hate to ask this question but how detrimental is it if I am unable to get this hose in completely?",

They called me and told me the tires are old and if I still wanna go forward with the adjustment. I said do it. (Tires were old but still had 5000 left on them. I replaced tires later too.) They \"did it\". He said the alignment wasn't that bad. That they adjusted it a bit. Drove it, the car is the same. Driving left on straight. Feels exactly the same. The steering wheel felt too tight and hard. Anyways. Took it to another firestone a week later (same tires, nothing changed). Tech came back and said he sees there are new suspension parts installed (i did not say it is the same as before). Showed me before and after and explained how bad it was and what he fixed. He said he can't do anything with the back as it is non adjustable. But the front was out of alignment. I took the car out, and voila. The steering wheel feels better, it goes straight, heck the light steering wheel shaking at 70mph even disappeared. So yeah. Some firestone places will take the money, do nothing and provide fake reports. Others are pure gold. Also their 1 year unlimited alignment plans are not unlimited. They will complain if you take it in for even the second time. They told me they do it twice only. So the unlimited, free, 1year, etc namings are just to get you to go with them.

    "selftext": "Apologies, tl;dr incoming but I am so frustrated. I have a 2013 Toyota Prius. A few weeks ago I got new tires (Michelin Defender T+H, which included alignment). I immediately noticed on the drive home that the car was pulling left - in order to go straight, I had to have the steering wheel tilted to the right. I went back in and they rechecked the alignment - lo and behold, despite telling me when I left the first time that it was perfect, one of the tires (the front right I think) was tilted. They fixed it and I headed home. The steering wheel now took me straight when it was straight, wonderful! However, over the next few days I noticed the steering wheel didn‚Äôt feel even on both sides. It is much easier (looser?) turning right than left. The wheel slowly moves back to neutral after turning right but snaps back to neutral (and then slightly beyond to the right) after turning left. I went back in and they told me this was likely due to ‚Äúmore aggressive treads‚Äù on the left and should settle as I drive more and wear them down. Both the mechanic and my advisor drove it around the lot and told me they noticed it but it was normal. But then last weekend I drove a 10-hour round trip and the entire time it felt like I had to physically pull the steering wheel to the left to keep it straight. Not a lot - I‚Äôm not wrenching the thing to the left or anything - but I have to exert small but continuous pressure (i.e., always pulling/pushing slightly to the left) to offset the way the wheel wants to tilt right (and thus take the car right now that it‚Äôs aligned). It‚Äôs most noticeable at highway speeds but I notice it on normal roads, too. The only way to get any relief was to ride in the fast lane and use the road's crowning to do the pushing for me. Is this really normal/likely due to treads pushing the steering wheel right? If so, how long can I expect this to last? Or could it still be an alignment issue or a tire that's defective? I know there are probably several reasons this could be, I‚Äôm looking for possible options to bring up if I take it back or just go to a new mechanic. I hate asking over and over for them to fix something they think isn‚Äôt an issue but if a tire could be defective I don‚Äôt want to lose out on some replacement period. I used to love driving long distances and now I dread it and feel like I‚Äôm fighting the car every moment of the drive, it‚Äôs even causing me some neck and shoulder strain. I feel like this is dumb because the pull is so minor but when I have to constantly maintain just a little pressure to keep the wheel straight, it adds up. I could really use some advice or reassurance that it will improve, I‚Äôve already driven about 1,000 miles with no change.",

Small background details, my apologies if I know too much about late 90's BMW radios. This is the BMW MK4 navigation system used in 2003+ BMW 5 series and X5. In these cars there was a screen up front, navigation computer and radio (basically the same radio from a non-nav car without a screen or CD drive) in the trunk. If you wanted to put a more modern radio you need an extension harness from the trunk to the center console. What they did for MINI is put the navigation computer under the passenger seat and they used the same exact radio up in the center console. Same connectors on all the radios, it just takes the navigation voice input on one of the aux/cd changer slots. I think it could be made to work unless the cars have totally different dashboards. They probably mean the dash lights won't work, and why would you want them to when the nav car has a cluster somewhere else. How much effort would it take? I couldn't tell you. It might plug and play or you might need to swap some wires. It might just fit in place or you might need to swap all the support brackets behind the stock navigation and various dash trim pieces over to make things fit.",

Has 100,000 miles, the Enclave has broken tire sensors (all four), a replaced AC, and now a vibration that‚Äôs quoted at $1,394 to fix. Friends suggest selling to Carvana for $7,500 and using Uber/transit instead, saying its cheaper than the repair, insurance I'll pay ($900/6 mo), and parking permit. But Buicks often last until 200,000 miles, and I‚Äôll definitely need reliable transportation for the next year. It seems smarter to make the repair and keep it until my long‚Äëterm needs are clear. What do you think? Is the $1,394 quote reasonable? That includes replacing rear tires (supposedly out of round) and engine motor (that shaking I see is abnormal and would cause vibration?

I want the car to sound a bit more aggressive and refined than stock, but I don‚Äôt want it to be too loud or obnoxious. Ideally, I‚Äôd like something with a deeper tone and more presence, but still daily-drivable and comfortable on the highway. I went to a local exhaust shop and they gave me a few suggestions. One option was to remove the center resonator and replace it with an X-pipe. Another option they mentioned was to delete the two rear mufflers. They also brought up a setup they‚Äôve seen before where Magnaflow resonators are installed in place of the center resonator along with an X-pipe. My biggest concern is drone, especially at cruising speeds. I want to avoid it as much as possible or keep it to a minimum. The shop said they weren‚Äôt sure how this platform responds to these changes in terms of drone, which makes me a little hesitant. My budget is around $400 maximum, and ideally I‚Äôd like to stay under that if possible. The shop also told me that the factory piping is 2.25 inches in diameter, if that helps with recommendations. If anyone has experience with this platform or has run similar setups, I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice. I‚Äôd also be interested in sound clips, specific part recommendations, or tips on keeping the tone sporty but still refined. Thanks in advance for your help!",

    "selftext": "So this may be kind of a weird question. But would like to have an affortable automatic car that does not creep when it's in gear. You know, when you shift into Drive, and you let go of the brake pedal, and the car will slowly move forward by itself. So I guess cars with this are mostly semi automatics (automated manuals). But even then, some manufacturers choose to artificially make the clutch behave like a torque converter and they programmed it in such a way that it will engage the clutch abit when the driver let go of the brake. But luckily not all semi automatics do that. Now I already know some semi automatics that don't creep: - first and second gen Smart Fortwo. - Fiat (grande) Punto from like 2007+. - some Citro√´n C4s from around 2010. - Citro√´n DS4. - Any Alfa Romeo with Selespeed tranny. - Mitsubishi Colt from like somewhere in the 00s. Not sure if that one creeps tho. Now you may say that many modern cars with automatics have a \"hold\" function, which basicly holds the brake for you. However that just covers the problem I have with traditional automatics rather than fixing it at the root. I want an automatic that when you drive and you let go of the gas, the car would automatically come to a full stop (if on a flat surface), instead of keep driving at 5-10 km/h. I'd love to hear your suggestions!",

I hit the guardrail head-on then came to a rest in the shoulder facing north in the southbound lane.

But thankfully my vehicle was the only automobile involved in the accident and I was uninjured. The vehicle front and sides sustained a good deal of damage and I have three flat tires.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has had these issues and if so, what was the solution? My car issues started out of nowhere in February, where it suddenly shut off at a light and when I tried to start it, it would start for a second and shut off again, making it impossible to move or anything. After 15-20 min, it started again as normal and was completely fine for two weeks and the same issue happened. (I dont believe it is the battery since the screens and all were completely okay) A friend said it could be the fuel injector? So he recommended putting the cleaner into the tank and after that I experienced no issues until about three weeks ago. This time, the issue was as I was making my regular commute to work in traffic, the engine temp on screen rose suddenly, and all of a sudden i‚Äôm getting engine overheat alerts. I pulled over as soon as I could and shut the car off. The engine didn‚Äôt seem hotter than usual or anything and I turned the car on again in about 5 min. The engine temp was completely normal, which is weird if the engine was actually overheating? But then I drove off normally, and in 2 min the engine stalled like it did in Feb. Then it didnt happen for a while and now this past week on Thursday and Friday, I‚Äôm getting rapidly fluctuating engine temps & engine overheating alerts. I had brought it to the dealership I bought the car from and they told me they couldn‚Äôt find any issues with the car. Basically I was just told to call them when the issue is present. The problem here though is that the car has these issues for about 30 min, then it drives and presents completely normal by the time anyone will probably get to me. Has anything similar happened to anyone else? If so, please let me know what your solutions were! Thank you üò≠ **in the attached video is a clip of when the car shuts off and engine wont turn on, and video of the engine temp fluctuating.",

        "body": "Either low on coolant causing pockets of hot air to hit the coolant temp sensor and make it fluctuate quickly, or a malfunctioning coolant temp sensor. Either way, modern cars go into limp-home mode, or shut off completely when they detect an overheat condition to try to protect the engine. Check your coolant level after the cars been cold for a good while. Look at the overflow reservoir and make sure the level is between the hot and cold levels on the bottle, or at least at the cold line if it's been sitting for hours. Also could check the radiator level, but make sure the cars been sitting for a few hours before removing that cap, as it can erupt hot coolant onto you if you take it off too soon after driving. If your levels are good, you don't see any coolant leaks in the engine bay or on the ground, and you don't see billowing white clouds of steam come out of your exhaust, it's probably safe to assume the coolant temp sensor or circuit has a problem. Your AC conpressor will leak condensation onto the ground, so if you see a single puddle of just water, it's probably not coolant. But give any puddles that accumulate under the car a sniff, as coolant has the distinct smell of antifreeze. I wouldn't drive the car until you can get it to the dealership, but whatever issue you may have should be covered under warranty. Make sure to show them this video so they don't just get in the car take it around the block and tell you \"couldn't replicate issue\"",

It rained heavily and when i got in my car the driverside floor was soaked so i know that has to be what caused it but i have no idea where the water is even coming from or where to start fixing it. Away from home for the moment because i ended up using moms car but any help or guidance for when i get home would be appreciated, thanks!",

We were turning it off there every time we used the car before we got an eliminator. I had an older jeep with autostop for a little while, and I hated the earlier implementation of it there, too. On my Ram? I don't even notice it. AC keeps running with it on (in fact, it won't even kick on if the temp is too high or low), and the truck starts as soon as I let my foot off the brake. I thought I was going to hate it - but I just leave it on, it's unobtrusive.",

It also has a 2nd battery with higher capacity and 48 volts to give more power. It's smooth, and all happens as you start to let off the brakes.

No of course the the downside of that is you do have to choose which firmware you want to run every time you start the car., but that's a small price to have to pay to get all that other cool s*** happening. Now the neat thing is you can also set it up so that it will always boot up in your Android firmware, but you do have to hook up a USB drive to get it so that when you restart the car it will restart and factory firmware. If you're in warranty, you're going to want to be able to do that before you take your car to the dealer. If you have any types of subscriptions like navigation or satellite radio, those will still work through the firmware update. You just have to re login to those. Which is why using the USB drive method to turn the firmware on and off and to keep it from you saying yes every time you start the car, it's again a small price to pay.",

If manufacturers didn't develop these technologies (auto start/stop, active fuel management, CVTs, hybrid technology, DCTs, etc) we would not have the performance that we enjoy today. Whether it's small displacement turbo engines or large displacement cam-in-block engines, these technologies allow for MPG and performance that could only be dreamed of 25 years ago. In 2000, the base Camry made 136hp and got 23 mpg (EPA city). You could cough up an addition $2K and get the V6 that made 194hp, but your mpg dropped to 20. Today that same model comes with 203hp and gets 28mpg. The V6 makes 301hp and gets 22mpg. The LS and LT engines from GM would not exist today were it not for auto start/stop and AFM. Those technologies allow a 500hp car to get pretty impressive REAL WORLD fuel mileage. For example, a 2000 Silverado made 285hp and got 14mpg (EPA city). A 2024 Silverado makes 355hp and gets 17mpg. Compare the highway mileage and that number is 17 and 24mpg. And the 2024 Silverado can easily weight 500lbs more than the 2000. All I'm saying is that without these technologies--in spite of the problems--driving today would be a sad affair.",

Properly done gasoline direct injection with port injection, and mild turbos, these are good for everyone. Low tension piston rings are just terrible, they reduce engine life immensely, same as wet belts, for very little gains.

Other companies shouldn't be able to sell their credits because they only want to make cars that exceed the standards. It's just dumb.

I have a 2013 Ford Fiesta SE, and wanted to check the brakes to make sure they're doing alright. Problem is, we live in a townhouse with a small parking lot. The parking lot has a small offshoot in which my dad keeps his old (not running) Saturn S-Series, which I think I would have enough room to work on the car in. He still says it's a bad idea, and that people will complain and report me to the landlord. My dad is known to be a very cautious and nervous man, so sometimes his advice can be overly cautious. Should I look into changing my own brakes, or bite the bullet and eventually pay for a shop to do so?",

Keep your work area looking clean and organized and make sure to clean up when you‚Äôre done (even sweep up the spots of rust and dirt that fall off the car). As far as actually turning the wrenches, brakes are a great place to start. It‚Äôs a simple and straight forward process that is semi universal across most vehicles.

You can try and re-seat the bumper clips, in case they got knocked loose but not cracked/destroyed, that would save you the cost of a replacement bumper. Then, buff out the scratches and wash off the paint transfer. Fixing the paint transfer will make the whole thing a lot less noticeable. The bent metal will be very difficult to fix, but if the plastic is bent at all, you can try to push it back into shape after heating it. Some people use heat guns or boiling water for that, that's tricky and risky, a hair dryer or even just a hot day are typically sufficient in my experience to make the plastic malleable. Some people are recommending oddball things, like using caustic chemicals to remove the paint transfer. Don't do that, or at least don't start with that. Try to remove it with soap and elbow grease first, you would be shocked by what just comes off without needing any extreme treatment. Best of luck in any case - in my somewhat-handy opinion, this will be a pretty difficult repair to make look nice.",

If you didn't read it, it's here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1kg2z7e/disappointed\\_with\\_full\\_detail\\_am\\_i\\_being\\_picky/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1kg2z7e/disappointed_with_full_detail_am_i_being_picky/) So I went back to the company that did the \"detail\" the day after. No yelling or rudeness etc, I just showed them all the stuff they didn't touch and explained that I wasn't satisfied. They didn't seem very interested in doing anything more to the car (they said they were fully booked for the next few weeks, their online booking didn't agree with that) but they did offer a refund so in the end I only paid for the exterior detail, which I was reasonably happy with as they did an okayish job with that. I obviously won't go back there though. I have this week off work (I work away from home every other week) so I decided to try to do it myself. Ordered some stuff, the refund covered most of it, and went to work. Bear in mind that this is just a total beginner working in his unpaved driveway, but I still feel it's a major improvement. The more obvious stuff like door pockets, dashboard, interor trim, trunk mat etc were obviously just a matter of wiping/brushing the dirt off. The side mirror came back better than I had expected considering it's 40 years and 200K miles old and honestly in need of replacement. They had obviosuly spent an absolute minimum of work on the seats and carpets. Some comments suggested they were simply worn out, but as you can see the seat came back nicely as well. I did my best with the engine bay and it's at least a huge improvement, although I need something else to get the glue residue off the firewall. The car is obviously old, well used and in dire need of a new paint job, but I still think the \"turd\" looks pretty nice.",

    "selftext": "Hello. I have a 2017 Chevy Cruze Hatchback LT. I think it's a 1.4 liter engine. I've had it for about 6 years. My car decided to take a crap on me an hour away from home. Somehow managed to get it back on and drive it home. Long story short, had to take it to the dealership to get worked on. Turns out my vacuum pump seal broke which damaged my camshaft and made the brake booster lose all power. The tech told the service dept. person I was working with that he doesn't know how I drove it home. They replaced my camshaft, the vacuum pump, a pcv orifice pipe, my spark plugs, and required an oil change. I've had the car back for about a week or so now. I can physically feel how much better the car drives. It shifts better (not as much jerking), the car doesn't shake at 75+ mph anymore, it doesn't hesitate to go when I press on the gas pedal, no more rough idling. I'm happy! But... Sometimes when my auto stop feature starts, when I go to let off the brake it takes a second to crank on.. like it's not super crazy, but the auto stop feature should absolutely just be able to turn the engine on instantly right? I don't recall my car doing this before. Turning the car on from it being completely off is the same too. Sometimes it takes a second or two of cranking before kicking on. Could it just be that it's learning the new parts since it went God knows how long with broken ones? I've not been able to take it on a long drive yet, just 2-3 15 minute trips to and from work everyday and maybe the store around the corner. I've watched my battery voltages during it to see if it was battery related (still need to get into my trunk to check the actual battery to ensure it's tight-- it was messed with when I first broke down because we were trying to see why the car died). When driving I'm around 13-14.5 V and when the auto start kicks on it drops IMMEDIATELY to 12-12.5V but then charges up just fine when the car starts running again. So I don't think it's battery related. Everything else google says is something I have no clue how to check or just seems a bit confusing/not on the mark. Is this worth going back to the dealership about? Is this a wait and see type of thing? Worth getting the check engine light codes checked out? (The check engine light is NOT on but I read that it still can have codes thrown). Please help! Thank you so much in advance!",

Dealerships are well known to rip people off. Find an independent mechanic with good reviews. Do not use a franchise place like Goodyear, Firestone, or whatever. The voltage fluctuations may be normal for your car. The voltage will drop when starting due to the load of the starter cranking the motor. I'm not a 2017 cruze expert, so I Googled this issue as you should have done already. It seems the most common issue is the battery. Do you know how old the battery is? You can go to an auto parts store like O'Reilly, and they can test the battery while it's in the car. The 2017 Cruze stop/start feature is known to have issues. If the car is running fine except for the stop/start feature, consider buying this stop/start eliminator off Amazon for $12. You don't need special tools. Just plug it in: https://a.co/d/bt9Quw3 Instructions on how to install it: https://a.co/d/bt9Quw3 Good luck!",

You're right I know, but that's the thing lol I did take it to an independent mechanic (great reviews by word of mouth and online) who did the research and looked into my car/forums and helped me out but did not have the correct machinery to work on my car. He's the one who suggested the dealership and ensured I had all the information beforehand so I wasn't screwed over. I also called the dealership out on the markup of pricing of their parts and they matched them and my independent mechanic said the total price I paid was correct and would have been about the same at his shop. I'm trying to do everything right. I have been googling religiously. I'm coming here as a last resort. I have googled every question under the sun it feels like and cannot find a straight answer that matches what's happening to me. I just was trying to see if anyone else had experienced this. My next step is going to AutoZone tonight after work and getting it tested as well as the engine codes to see if it is throwing anything that I can look into deeper. It's not just the auto start function, it happens when turning the car on as well so I don't think it's just that. I appreciate you trying to help and giving me advice. Have a good day.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I‚Äôm trying to fix up my girlfriend‚Äôs 2008 honda civic with 200k miles on it for her daughter who is about to drive. Problem is, we don‚Äôt know the last time the ATF fluid was changed. We know it has been changed. But we don‚Äôt know how often or at what mileage. And I know it gets risky to change once 100k or more miles have built up on the same fluid - Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. Is there a way for me to check without doing drain and fills and risking killing the transmission? Like, can I siphon out a little bit with a syringe and send it to a lab or something? Maybe the lab can give me an analysis with an estimate on how many miles are on the fluid?",

You could see all around, the D16 was not fast but the car was light so it felt nimble. It had ABS, but it let me drive. When it broke, it was mechanical. Never was a computer having a fit and throwing problems that required specialized tools. I fixed that car with $50 worth of tools from any hardware store. Sadly I had to sell that car when I moved from Mexico back to Canada. Now I have an 09 Civic DX sedan and while it feels a lot bigger than my 6th gen, it's a lot of the same story. I had a 2011 Honda fit that had traction control and that was kind of nice in the winter. Fortunately I was able to turn it off when I wanted. My 2008 Cobalt had traction control and the only way to disable it was the trick the car into thinking I had the handbrake pulled. My father has a 2022 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk and it literally rips the wheel from his hand when he tried to avoid a suddenly stopped car on the highway. It manged to stop the Jeep and we didn't hit anybody, even luckier there was nobody behind us but holy shit was that scary. The two lanes to the left were clear and the Jeep wouldn't let him make the safest decision. Backup sensors and automatic braking drive me wild. I understand that these features largely assist the average person, but as a driving enthusiast can I get a car that doesn't have all that shit? My favorite cars are thirty, going on forty years old and I don't want to get any new ones because they're so jam packed full of bullshit. Rant over.",

And certainly a bad UI could, in theory, be completely replaced by a better design. I don't mind the fake exhaust so much once I was clued in that a minor rear end accident could damage the drivetrain upstream if the exhaust was longer. It's a simpler (cheaper) solution than engineering a weak point in the exhaust system and reduces the cost of repairs in that situation. I'm also not mourning the loss of the shifter since everything is automatic now anyway. I like shifters, and appreciate my manual cars, but pushing a button, sliding a thing, rotating a dial ... unless I'm in a situation where I would change gear selection frequently, I just don't see why it's a problem.

There is no need for a traditional automatic gear shifter, and replacing them with fully electronic, button based shifters has more benefits than the big shift lever could ever offer. What benefit does the traditional gear shifter offer you? I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs only the perceived emotions of some amount of manliness, toughness, ruggedness, etc. The transmissions themselves are fully electronic these days, so a big shift knob isn‚Äôt doing anything that a button can‚Äôt do. They used to have a bit more of a mechanical operation, but that‚Äôs been gone for generations of vehicles at this point. The button shifters can allow for more room for other features; usually cup holders/storage in the center console area. But the biggest thing they can offer is safety. It can be very easy for an automaker create the automatic shift to park as soon as the driver door is opened with a fully electronic shifter. I believe it was tried with a traditional shifter, but it‚Äôs much easier to implement with a button based shifter versus a moving shift lever.",

My 2011 Edge was Peak Car, Had all the modern convenience's without going overboard. ‚Ä¢ Auto Cruise adjustment and brake alert, but using a sensor in the front bumper not the windshield it only ever failed during big blizzards, my bronco sport freaks out if the sun hits it the wrong way or you get a bug splatter anywhere near the sensor in the window.

I bought a car, I didn't sign up to have Ford listen to everything I say and do, and get every false-positive bug splat windshield error code to share with whoever willing to buy that data.

I was heavy on the gas peddle not long before i hit it and i felt a slight hesitation when it went to downshift. Right after hitting it, when speeding up the car started to stutter and hesitate when giving it throttle. Turned around and drove it straight to the dealer. They looked at it and said the pothole shocked the car and broke the coil pack. I've never heard of this before, and just last thursday I had the spark plugs replaced by the dealer. Should I believe them, or could they have damaged the coil pack when changing the spark plugs? This dealer has not had the best of service, they had replaced the front and back brakes (disk and pads) when the spark plugs got changed last week. Walked out after paying and the back brakes already had grooves that my finger nail would catch on, so they took it back and replaced them again. Thank you to anyone that helps.",

Anything is possible, but no, hitting a pothole and an ignition coil coming loose is not some normal thing that happens. Even people getting in actual wrecks don't typically have the ignition coils lose contact. They messed up, but good luck getting them to admit to it.",

Dirty throttle body can cause \"suddenly turns off while driving\", especially on deceleration and low speed scenarios. The dirty/sludged up throttle plate rim restricts airflow into the engine or can possibly block all airflow depending on the angle - causing a shutoff You won't notice symptoms when accelerating because the throttle body plate opens wider when the gas pedal is pressed - allowing the necessary airflow to keep the engine running. But at low speeds and during braking, the throttle plate closes - cutting off the air Oh and it doesn't set a check engine light or codes usually. Ask me how I know üòÖ... I was chasing my tail for weeks when my old Jeep started randomly stalling at stoplights, turned out the throttle body was dirty/gummed up and the engine could barely breathe Anyways, it's something you can check for free",

If there is corrosion inside they will recommend a whole new engine which it's either that or a rebuild if possible but a new/ used engine is way cheaper.",

The engine itself seems to have a few surface issues and I've been told that it could just be swapped with a 1.9 tdi since we have some on hand.

    "selftext": "I have been having a reoccurring problem with my 2013 Subaru Impreza where my key would get stuck in the ignition. I have taken it to a shop but they couldn't recreate it because it isn't completely consistent, just regular The exact issue is that I can't turn the key from the ACC position to the lock position to remove it. I have tried wiggling the steering wheel, making sure it was in park, turning the wheel, so many things but it isn't working. Sometimes I do nothing, turn the key to on, and then I can take it out again. I plan to take it to the shop again when I can but I can't for a bit. The actual key part of the key is loose with the actual fob, can this be the issue? Thanks for any help you can give Edit: I eventually managed to get my normal key out, and I used a spare back up key I have. That key also got stuck so that isn't it. I got the normal key out right after moving my gear shifter around for a bit. I got the backup key out after wiggling the steering wheel. Before both of these I tried both of those solutions and they didn't work until they suddenly did.",

    "selftext": "2006 Mitsubishi Lancer ES, 61,000 miles I went to pick up my car from my mechanic. He fixed a previous low idling issue, but while still in the mechanic parking lot I turned on the AC and notice the rpm dropped from 800 to about 550 and then when I turned on the AC blower fans for my AC it dropped below 500 causing the check engine light to come on. A couple of weeks ago I suspect that my power steering also put too much load on the car causing the rpm to get stuck at around 500 which was the reason why my car was at the mechanic in the first place. I was trying to park my car so I was turning the steering wheel a lot which was engaging the power steering. What would be the cause if my car starts to idle so low that the check engine light comes on if you put too much load on the engine? The throttle body has been cleaned and so has the MAF sensor.",

    "selftext": "Around 93k miles, I DIYed a transmission fluid and filter change for a 2016 Mazda CX-5. That procedure involved removing the RTV sealant gasket that came from the factory, doing the service, and replacing with the cellulose gasket that came with [this filter](https://www.rockauto.com/en/moreinfo.php?pk=11963321&cc=3312788&pt=8600). I scraped the sealant, used brake cleaner and isopropyl alcohol to prep the surface. I do remember having a tough time keeping the gasket aligned to the pan, especially when the gasket was stored tangled in a box for a month or so. I managed to have it reasonably aligned, and torqued the transmission pan bolts to 7-10 Nm (62-88 inch-pounds or 5.2-7.4 ft-pounds). No leaks immediately after completion... https://preview.redd.it/x0ipi7a9z60f1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5c04bf353c976b76fcd1d85db5d880ee76439ce https://preview.redd.it/g108ca6bz60f1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc735b8be9f66729ed84041fdeed29eaba15f5a7 Then about a month or so later, I noticed a minor leak, and upon further inspection (see photos) noticed that the gasket has split around the bolts. There are many instances of the gasket being split like that around the pan. I'm wondering what I can do better when installing the next gasket. According to the product page linked prior, one thing I did not do was \"Apply [Multi Purpose Grease](https://www.rockauto.com/en/tools/garage+equipment,fluid+/+chemical,multi-purpose+grease,16795) or [Rebuild Lubricant](https://www.rockauto.com/en/tools/transmission-automatic,fluid+/+chemical,transmission+rebuild+lube,1001874) to the edges of the fluid plan to hold the new gasket in place during installation\". There also may be a difference in the torque spec of the RTV sealant v. the other gasket?",

Brakes were working fine until I was having to start pushing all the way down for them to engage. While looking for a safe spot to pull off the brakes did have a few instances where they were fine, but would go back to me having to push all the way down to the floor to for them to work. Finally pulled over on the interstate and immediately checked to see if there was a leak and didn‚Äôt see anything. At this point the wife is freaking out asking what is wrong. Told her could be air in the lines or the master cylinder failed. Ended up getting the car towed back to town to the local shop. Fast forward to about an hour ago. Guy from the shop called and said the he couldn‚Äôt reproduce the issue that I had experienced . Said he didn‚Äôt see any leaks and that there was plenty of fluid as well.

A friend of mine, same stuff but he was getting very little air from the brake pump. And a guy I know had a faulty cap, that was not sealing right and air came through a few days he bleed it out.",

The car also doesn't have a cigarette lighter/any way to charge my phone so if you know anything about fitting that lmk.

I did notice the upper radiator hose that returns to the engine was broken, so I replaced this hose and the issue persists. My coolant reservoir was also more full than usual, it was near the hot fill line while being both hot and cold. I drained the coolant and refilled it to the cold line and it still doesn‚Äôt rise with heat. The drained coolant was normal color. The radiator does spin and it seems like once it does start spinning is when the overheating really starts. Does this seem like a thermostat or a water pump issue or maybe a blockage somewhere, the thermostats aren‚Äôt super hard to replace on this car so I‚Äôm gonna work on that next just would like some other input from more experienced people.",

It‚Äôs possible the mechanic didn‚Äôt properly clean and grease the caliper guide pins during the brake job, which would cause the caliper to stick and the outer pad to wear out much faster than normal. Skipping that step or rushing the install is an easy way for this kind of damage to happen. It‚Äôs also possible the caliper was fine at the time of the brake job and just started sticking afterward, which would be bad luck rather than the shop‚Äôs fault. Either way, the rotor is likely ruined now, and the car will need a new rotor, new pads, and at least a new caliper on that side.

    "selftext": "I have a 2011 Mercedes Benz that started showing a white temperature symbol and the car's temperature goes up to around 100 degrees at which point the radiator fan starts very loud and the temperature drops to around 90 degrees and the white temp symbol goes away. I've done a ton of reading and I've found that there are 3 possible reasons why this happens, one is a bad coolant temp sensor, two is a bad radiator fan and three would be a bad AC pressure sensor. I started checking the car and realized the coolant temp sensor connector was broken, since I work as an Engineering Tech I had some wires with female pins laying around that fit perfectly on the two coolant temp sensor so I decided to get rid of the bad connector and connect the coolant temp sensor directly to the two wires after removing the connector. I tested the car by driving it around for around 1 hour and the first thing i noticed is that the tempersture doesnt go all the way up to 100 degreed anymore but the white temp symbol still pops up on my dashboard, mind you i live in LA and today's temperature was the high 90s. The second thing I noticed is that when the white temp symbol pops up the AC stops blowing cold air, when the fan starts blowing real loud the white temp symbol goes away and the AC starts blowing cold air again, however the temperature shown in the temp gauge doesn't go above 90 degrees. I've checked and made sure the radiator fan works, I've made sure there's enough coolant in the reservoir, I don't see any coolant leaks coming from the thermostat or from the water pump, I'm not sure how to go about troubleshooting this problem, the only thing I have not checked is the AC pressure switch because I don't know what role this switch/sensor plays in all of this. Does anyone have any suggestions or advise, I don't see any error codes related to the radiator fan or coolant temp sensor with my ODB II scanner. I've attached 2 images of the white temp symbol and the temp gauge as I was driving back from the car wash today, as you guys can see the temperature doesn't look high enough to throw that symbol, but maybe I am missing something.

        "body": "The thermostat could be sticking instead of just leaking. You can remove it and test it with hot water. As the water heats up the thermostat should open to allow for coolant flow. As the water cools the thermostat should close again to reduce the amount of coolant flowing in the system. If the thermostat is stuck the fans have to pick up the slack of cooling the engine which also means rerouting from AC work to engine cooling. Edit: Removing the thermostat will drain the coolant loop so you'll need to top it off with the correct coolant. Otherwise just do a full coolant flush and replace. The bottom of the radiator usually has a drain plug to remove the rest of the coolant from the system",

I buy all my parts from RA, much cheaper and I've practically never had a problem, my uncle is a mechanic and gets most all his stuff from RA as well (for side projects) and hasn't had issues. It's a well known site for parts but what matters is what part you order, personally I wouldn't go with a reman and would get a new one. For example if you buy Denso it's a high quality brand that makes OE parts, but if you buy Pure Energy they are a low quality brand and the parts going to be low quality Not all parts they sell are reman, and not sure where you found the reviews of the site but that's shockingly low lol",

I paid once for the starter and have replaced it 5 times for free. the first time it died I bought some starter without a lifetime warranty that probably last 2 years before it started to fail. went with the lifetime warranty and never paid an extra cent since swapping them in and out. tldr get a lifetime warranty from a reputable place locally that will stand behind their warranty.",

Two days ago i got out of work and went to start my 328i bmw when it wouldn‚Äôt start. the key worked and the locks too but when i put the key in and pushed the start button it would just make a clicking sound. so my dad came and jumped it and it started right up like normal and i drove it home. we just put a new battery in it back in march so we thought maybe it was a faulty battery. we took it back with the receipt and got a replacement. yesterday it started right up like normal and i drove it twice, but after less than an hour later when i went to drive it again, it clicked again but this time all the electronics came on for a split second before everything just completely shut off and the key became stuck. i managed to pull it out without anything breaking but now absolutely nothing works or turns on. the only sign of life is the emergency blinker button is flashing really really fast. jumping it isn‚Äôt working so as of right now we can‚Äôt even get to the battery because it‚Äôs in the trunk and we can‚Äôt open it. has this happened to any of you? if so, what could it be and how can it be fixed?

Check main fuses (especially in the glove box and near the battery once you get access). If still dead, it could be a blown fuse, bad ground, faulty IBS sensor, or even a failing FEM module.

There is a hidden menu on the E90 so you can see it on the dash if you don't have a multimeter (you should probably still get one). IIRC voltage will cycle between 13 and 14.5ish on that car. If it doesn't, you have a problem with your alternator. If it does, look elsewhere (parasitic loss, IBS, etc.). Common IBS issues manifest as all kinds of silly things - blower randomly shutting off is the obvious one I've encountered. You can unplug its signal wire if that's the issue. IBS can prevent the car from starting if it's borked. You can use a multimeter to check for parasitic drain. There's a spec somewhere on allowable current with everything off (it takes a few minutes after turning the car off), which I'm sure you can find in a service manual or with a little Googling. Note: If replacing the alternator, you'll want to pull off or inspect the original to make sure you're getting the right replacement, because the two different makes have different pulleys. Make sure you get new bolts as aluminum bolts are one-time use and they must be aluminum because the block is magnesium. Use a torque wrench. Source: E90 owner for many years and 150k+ miles üëç",

I found some 235/55R19 (wheel + tire) mounted on Marketplace, also from another Ford Flex but it's 2010 model. The center bore and bolt patterns all seems to be the same size. Also the offset range is the same (37-41). [Wheel-size.com](http://Wheel-size.com) tell me that it should work. I just want a second opinion before I buy it.

I‚Äôve replaced the brake light switch but the lights still do not go off unless I disconnect the connection to the brake light switch. Additional info: I replaced the bulbs in my tail lights because the driver side was out. After replacing the brake light bulbs it resolved the issue while it was in park but in drive the driver side tail light still wouldn‚Äôt work. I ordered a brake light switch to replace it and while waiting for the part to deliver my check engine light came on, ABS, and my VSC trac. Also while my car was off, I removed the brake light switch and depressed the plunger with it still connected to verify the brake lights went off and they did. I haven‚Äôt noticed any weird resistance when braking and I honestly can‚Äôt tell if the brake pedal comes all the way forward or not? So it‚Äôs my brake pedal or brake fluid possibly? Or something else, fuse maybe? I‚Äôve been overcharged at mechanics before for being a woman or told them what I thought the issue was, they‚Äôd say it wasn‚Äôt that, and I was back in a month replacing the same thing I thought it was.

Heating any pump up to operating temp can reduce operation noise. Heating up a bad pump can significantly reduce excessive noise as heat can improve sealing capability and operating tolerances, as well as THIN the oil especially if it's significantly worn oil. Sounds from pumps don't necessarily mean they're on their way out, but they can be good indicators. Yes it could be a belt, pully/tensioner included, ac clutch, and then some. The best way to trouble shoot is with a stethoscope or other sound amplifier, or with the engine off remove the belt and start spinning and wiggling all the pulleys listening for sounds and wobbles. It depends. But absolutely possible.

    "selftext": "I bought a 2020 Volvo V60 from Carvana about four months ago with ~20k miles. After some recent severe weather, I discovered 2‚Äì3 inches of water in the passenger footwell. The service center says the likely cause is a poorly sealed sunroof and clogged drains. Now the car is throwing a ton of system errors and they‚Äôre recommending a full teardown to diagnose potential module damage. What‚Äôs frustrating is that I had this same shop inspect the car within a week of buying it and they gave it a clean bill of health (just did an oil change and replaced the cabin filter). Insurance is involved and will cover costs going forward, but I‚Äôm still frustrated and unsure what to expect. Has anyone dealt with something similar? What would you do in my shoes?",

I obtained the repair manual from allcarmanuals d.ot com. Here are the front brake specs: https://preview.redd.it/oru1vu1vvxze1.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=37a235924acd8d13ebb3e2490fa9f7654ed626ca The disc pads should be (area x thickness) 4,010 x 12.0 Makes sense, ok. So the thickness should be 12.0 milimeters. It seems that I can't find any \"fitting\" pads that are even remotely close to these dimensions. Let me give you an example: autodoc do.t uk is a well-known european retailer of car parts. When I input the car there, and look for brake pads, select the front axle, they are all A LOT thicker: https://preview.redd.it/66cohubkwxze1.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ae46863ecda3d90b22d944d7e2a3c74e43d7a7 See this? These are 6.5mm thicker. That's over half a centimeter! I have significant doubts over whether these will fit. And I can't find others that would fit. In fact, I searched over 10 retailers. They always give values for pads that are way too thick for this car (?) Now, clearly, I'm a noob, so I ask you, please, help me figure out what I'm missing. In addition to all this, I also searched for the discs for this car. While I was able to find a couple results that fit the service manual, 80% of the results were way off. How are they meant to fit? I tried countless sites - surely they can't all be wrong? Can they? Thanks a lot in advance.",

There are ground straps (wide, flat, and unshielded wires) that connect the engine to the frame, and those are critical for the car to function correctly. Find them and inspect them. Chances are they are either badly corroded or broken. If they are not, start checking connections from your starter to make sure it's getting 12v and is grounded appropriately. If it is, but doesn't even click when you turn the ignition, you can either test the signal from the ignition to the solenoid with someone holding the key, test the solenoid on the car (they make a button with wires for that, but there are more hackey ways to do it), or pull the starter and take it to a parts store to get tested.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, Today, I managed to replace the air intake tube (that connects the air filter housing to the engine). However, in the process of taking out the air filter housing so I could replace the air intake tube, I somehow managed to get the grommet / rubber seat that is normally attached to the housing onto the \"peg\" (where the air filter is supposed to sit). Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/Y6Le3lt3E3w?t=261) (by someone else) of what I mean by the \"grommet\" or \"rubber seat.\" If it doesn't already, it is described at around 4:21. Basically, that \"rubber seat\" is no longer on the housing; where the \"rubber seat\" is, is now just a plastic ring. The \"rubber seat\" is stuck on the place where the air filter housing is supposed to sit. **As a result, I've had no luck in trying to get the** ***whole*** **air filter housing back on the place where it's supposed to sit.** Emphasis on whole -- if I take the lid off the air filter housing, then I can move the bottom part of the housing around in different angles until I force it onto the place where it's supposed to sit. But, when the lid is on, it becomes a lot harder for me. Also, with the way the car is designed, the whole housing needs to be put into the right spot -- you cannot put the bottom part of the housing in, and then put the lid of the housing in afterwards. I was able to put the two 10mm bolts back on the air filter housing, which I believe bolts them into the car (see around 1:44 in the aforementioned video for what I mean). Additionally, the air filter housing still feels almost like as if I didn't take it out originally; that is to say, it *feels* secure. I also did a test drive (30 miles, consisting of a mix of highway and city driving) after replacing the air intake tube, and the main issues I had with the car are no longer there, which is what I was hoping to get out of this. I do hear some rattling when driving, but I believe that is from the splash shield not being installed correctly. I don't think there's any sounds coming from the air filter housing. I guess my question is: **should I still try to get the air filter housing back on where it's supposed to sit, or will it be fine to leave it alone?** I also plan on going to the mechanic tomorrow to ask them this same question, but I figure I might as well ask here in case someone might experience with this. Let me know if you need any clarification, and I appreciate any advice! The car is a 2012 Honda Civic LX (4 cylinder, 1.8L).",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. Recently in my car a weld between an exhaust pipe and a muffler burned out (see pics 3 and 4). I inspected the whole exhaust system and noticed a couple of things: 1. Theres almost nothing left from the heat shield thats near the exhaust manifold (see 1st pic). Should i change it, or maybe it doesnt matter? 2. Flexible connection (pic 2) is starting to have a gap between it and the exhaust pipe. Is it minor or major issue? 3. And finally the weld between exhaust pipe and the muffler (pic 3 and 4) is done. I can see that somebody tried (very poorly) to weld it in the past. And now the weld a couple of inches/milimeters away from it burned. Is it logical to cut off that poorly welded part of the exhaust pipe, and weld (more accurately) new piece of pipe? 4. As I understand, if I fix these places, then after some time holes will form in new (weakest) places. For example somewhere in the middle of the car. Would it be better to just buy whole new exhaust system? Adding the pics: https://imgur.com/a/IEY66iB Thanks for any help.",

The package included 23mm ballistic glass, ballistic steel and polyurethane filling, which added approximately 350kg to the car's weight. Since the armouring, the suspension feels far too soft and unstable ‚Äî the car leans heavily in corners and feels floaty at speed. The company who did the armouring says they can ‚Äúadjust‚Äù the suspension, but I‚Äôm looking for a proper, long-term solution. I‚Äôm particularly interested in upgrading to something like Bilstein, but I‚Äôm open to suggestions (KW, Koni, Eibach, etc.). My goal is to restore firmness and stability without making the ride unbearably harsh. Has anyone reinforced their suspension after armouring a vehicle like this? Appreciate any advice or shared experiences!",

Getting a spring will require you reaching out to someone like H&R, Eibach or Swift to have a custom spring made. Either way, the car will handle worse than stock. It‚Äôll roll more either way. Get smaller wheels with tires that don‚Äôt larger side walls to allow for a more compliant ride.",

I run a plastics-processing company here in Mexico and, while Mexico is a great country, some areas where my clients are located can be rough. I often have to visit factories or offices in industrial neighbourhoods that aren‚Äôt exactly the safest spots, so the extra protection is just a practical precaution. Being a tall, white, blond guy doesn‚Äôt help either‚Äîpeople tend to assume you‚Äôre a millionaire just by looking at you. The armour keeps things low-stress when I‚Äôm out on the road. Your suggestion about custom-valved shocks and bespoke springs makes total sense. I‚Äôll start talking to Bilstein (or maybe KW) and see about getting the dampers re-valved and proper springs made by H&R, Eibach or Swift. I‚Äôll also look into downsizing the wheels to get taller sidewalls for a bit more compliance. Really appreciate you taking the time to spell it all out‚Äîcheers!",

    "selftext": "Howdy folks, Been doing some maintenance items for the first time and last night replaced my valve gasket cover on my 2012 Civic Hybrid (158K miles) after i found oil on my spark plugs when changing them out two weeks ago. I was installing things back and putting the bolt on the right side of the wiring harness for the spark plugs, and dropped the dang bolt on the right side the secures it in place-behind/to the right of the gasket. I tried use my phone and lights and what not last night to find it but wasn't able to do so. I'm checking again today. Nonetheless, Im wondering....is that liable to cause any problems? Thankfully I didnt drop it into the engine (without the gasket cover) or something terrible. I just dont wanna start this car and then something go wonky or some Final Destination type crap happen and my car goes kaput. Can anyone give feedback here? **TLDR**: Was working on my 2012 civic hybrid to replace the vale gasket cover and accidentally dropped the securing bolt of the right side of the wiring harness for the spark plugs, behind/to the back right the gasket cover. Is this liable to cause any issues in my engine (when I start my car) if I cant find it?",

As you can see from the video turning the wheel to the left doesn't triggers it but anytime I turn it to about 90% to the right all those warnings lights come on. The car however still \"seems\" to work just fine, as in braking works normally, the parking brake, e brake, and brake hold all work like normal. What could be causing the issue? Some background info: this started happening today. No incidents has happened recently. However I will admit the car has been needing an alignment check/correction (car slightly drifts to the right) for quiet some time now, roughly about a year that I been neglecting to do. Maybe that's the correlation? Probably also important to note that about 3 years ago the right driver wheel lost a stud and I been driving on 4/5 studs (however wheel is stable and not loose) I'm admitting fault and it could have been preventable however I would like to know what's going on, how bad is it and is it drivable until I can go to a mechanic this Monday?",

My mechanic discovered that within the space where the idle air control valve sits and connects to the throttle body there is some coolant seeping in. He thinks that the section of the gasket that sits between the coolant chamber and idle air control valve chamber has failed and is allowing coolant to get sucked into the idle air control valve chamber causing the low idle and stalling issue. Finding a replacement gasket is hard and almost impossible because of how old this car is. What he did is a coolant bypass so coolant is now rerouted and not going into the throttle body anymore and is just flowing back to where it came from. He told me that after doing this the car ran fine and idle was stable. He also told me that coolant does not need to flow into the throttle body especially because I live in Southern California which is a warm climate so this could be a permanent fix and I don't think the gasket needs to be replaced either because coolant wasn't leaking outwards, but instead it was seeping from one chamber to another. **I'm usually a skeptical and paranoid person so I just wanted to know if any mechanics can confirm to me that this was the issue all along. If coolant gets into the idle air control valve chamber and then the pintle on the idle air control valve opens to allow air in and instead coolant is sucked in as well can that cause low idle rpm and stalling?** The throttle body was cleaned 1 1/2 years ago and the idle air control valve is a brand new OEM version that is only 1 1/2 half years old too. The current mechanic also cleaned the MAF sensor and tried to start the car and it wouldn't. This was before he discovered the leak.",

When he followed me back to my house to drop off the car, started smoking up again in about 5 min, temperature reaching H again. Technician said temperature gauge is not working correctly and he said he didn't notice anything leaking when I was driving.

We signed a contract stating we would only allow THEIR APPROVED mechanics to work on it. About a month ago my vehicle started making a really hard jerking sound and vibration. I had my uncle who is a mechanic LOOK at my vehicle just to see what may be the issue to give me an estimate on how much it might cost to fix it and found out that whoever owned the vehicle in the past whether it was the car company or previous SPRAY FOAMED a frame and painted it black to make it look like a metal frame. So I have been driving this car a little over a year with my disabled parents and disabled son without knowing I was in a literal death trap. I want to give the car back and just be done with it but the company is telling me I will owe whatever it costs to fix the car before I can return it. Mind you all, I originally came in there wanting a 2014 Chevy Equinox but they said they couldn't give me that car but had the 2013 Chevy Equinox that they could in fact lease to me. I honestly feel like I was set up. I just need to know if I have case or not, and if so what type of attorney do I need to contact regarding this issue. Only asking for advice please keep all negativity to yourself. I need help and I would appreciate only advice instead of judgment or negativity. Thank you",

Im assuming thats what you mean by lease since leases are only for brand new. And you signed a contract that specifies you use their mechanics? Im also going to assume that means they provided you with a vehicle service contract (commonly called an extended warranty). If it is one they provide in-house on all their cars it can specify that it only covers the cost of repairs at their shop, and that repairs you have done elsewhere would not be covered. This is pretty common when a dealership provides these for free on their cars. Before you purchased the car, who did you take it to in order to have a pre-purchase inspection done? Did they note the frame issue? The service contract the dealership provided you with at time of purchase.. what does it cover? Is it mechanical only? Is it bumper to bumper? How many years and miles? You should black out your personal information and post it. It's been two years, not two weeks, so you're likely on your own. However if they do have a rust/corrosion warranty in there you could have some coverage. You'll also have what's called a buyers guide. It says what the warranty is and whether the car was sold as-is.",

Just know that not all tools are made equal. A $20-30 cheapo scan tool or phone dongle will read basic OBD codes and maybe a few other modules. This might be enough in many cases. But get into the $100+ dongles and you get live data, bi-directional functions, and a mess of other nifty capabilities. Also pro shops often carry dealer only scan/update tools that cost thousands. I recently had a dodge dart with an infotainment error recorded by the bcm. The only real fix for this was for the software to be updated at the dealer. So not much saved in that instance.",

I'd pick up some dielectric grease at the auto store. You can usually get a little packet as it goes a long way. You might want to grab a cheap battery terminal cleaning tool as well. I think they're a few dollars. Also, check the positive side as well. Probably wouldn't hurt to clean and grease that side, too, skipping the baking soda mess if there's no visible corrosion.

Bluetooth and phone call works fine, just the touchscreen stopped working. I'd prefer to DIY the replacement rather than pay over $1,100 to an audio shop to install an aftermarket one. One thing I looked at was possibly buying the same radio on ebay: [https://www.ebay.com/itm/164225640198](https://www.ebay.com/itm/164225640198) . However, I read that sometimes there are VIN locks, issues with programming with the steering wheel, and other problems (e.g. ebay motors not being great for parts), so now I'm worried. It looks legit and easy to plug in, but I want to make sure. Can I buy the radio replacement via ebay, and will it work as easy as plug and play? Or are there issues such that I should look at aftermarket radios (e.g. Crutchfield) if I want to DIY it? https://preview.redd.it/2pc2148tjjze1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11b35bc190d7cd35a235b094cbd6133523f754e3",

When it switches from dim to full bright, that's when it starts hyperflashing. As far as I can tell, the explorer doesn't use a flasher relay but just reads resistance and the BCM changes the timing as an \"error code\".

While the protection is great, the suspension didn‚Äôt hold up well after the armor was installed. It now feels too soft, unstable, and bouncy, especially at speed or when turning. The shop that did the armoring says they can ‚Äúadjust‚Äù it, but I‚Äôm not fully confident they know the best suspension solution for this kind of setup. Does anyone have experience or solid recommendations for upgrading suspension on a vehicle with added weight like this? I‚Äôve heard of brands like Bilstein, KW, Koni, and Ohlins‚Äîwould any of these work well with a 350kg weight increase? I want something that restores stability and handling without making the ride overly harsh. Thanks in advance for any help or shared experiences.",

On the fifth try or so it stopped and I was able to drive off. I took it in to get an oil change and my transmission fluid replaced the next day and the sound stopped for a month. (My oil was severely low even though I wasn't due for another 1000 miles) Flash forward to this week, it happened again. I took it to an auto shop and they couldn't recreate it or pin down the issue. While I was there I got my front ujoint replaced and a leak on my transfer case fixed. I've also routinely checked my oil levels and they look good. I thought that may have fixed it but the sound has come back. Btw, I pretty much only ever drive in 2wd mode. Tldr: Weird growling sound and shaking happens out of the blue sometimes when I drive at low speeds. This continues to happen every time I turn on the car until eventually it stops and I am gtg.",

Cover the alternator and distributor perhaps? Or just blow it out if any moisture gets in?

It's in the grooves and would need a bit of work, but still. \\- Various dirt left on on the interior. Door pockets, trunk area, \\- I paid extra to have the seats cleaned. They didn't bother reclining the seats so they missed a lot of dirt. \\- They treated most of the faded plastic, but didn't bother with the driver side mirror. \\- Side windows were obviously cleaned while closed, so they are still dirty on top.

We are always cautious working on old surfaces. There is a fine line between cleaned and detailed. Some materials will not come all the way back. So we clean them and simply dress the surfaces lightly. 2. Glass is always tricky. Was polishing the glass part of the conversation with the detailer? At the end of the day ALWAYS have a conversation about what the expected/agreed upon finished product will look like. Under promise and over deliver.

A while back the engine sometimes got stuck at very high rpms for idle, around 3-4k and wouldnt go away unless restarting the engine a few times. I changed the idle control valve and the throttle sensor and the problem went away. Last week I started misfiring which I diagnosed to be the ignition coil so I swapped that, spark plugs and the wires. Problem went away. Now my problem is that the car does all these things again, plus makes a really awful noise (see video). I honestly have no clue what this could be. Any ideas?

My mechanic believes just the clutch is going, as the other compressor belts are still working. His advice is **just** to get a denso compressor and he will do the replacement. While searching for parts I found a kit for about 40$ more that comes with an expansion valve and drier replacement. I assume this would probably add more cost in labor to replace those, but I don't know how much. Just replacing the compressor, my mechanic would still have to open and flush the system, right? So in my head, might as well fix those parts while it's open. **Here's the tricky part** while my current compressor hasn't catastrophically failed, this is my second compressor. Previous owner replaced the compressor in 2018 with one from a junk yard, didn't change any other parts in the AC system. I have no idea if there are metal shavings in the system that are maybe all hanging out in the condenser. My mechanic doesn't think I need it, but it's only 80 dollars for a new denso condenser. For peace of mind should I insist on replacing both? And either way, 15 years of New England wear and tear on the condenser can't be nothing. Again, more labor costs I'm sure, but I don't know how much that changes the job.",

    "selftext": "About a year ago, I was driving about 70mph on the freeway on cruise control. I feel the car start to lose momentum and look down to see I‚Äôm losing speed. I press the gas to speed up and nothing happens. I pulled over and came to a stop. I press the gas again and it starts to move somewhat normally; however, when I press the gas harder than the car wants, it starts to sputter. So I basically get it home driving 30-40mph making sure I press the gas very lightly. Took it to a shop‚Ä¶ $3500 later I have a list of things that they fixed that went wrong. Whatever.. I don‚Äôt know anything about cars so just needed it fixed. Didn‚Äôt think twice about it. Ran fine until last week. Same exact issue. Heading to work on cruise control when the car starts slowing down. Give it gas - same exact thing. Drive home going 30-40. At 40 it seems to start sputtering the same way it does when I press the gas ‚Äòtoo hard‚Äô. I pull out my packet from when it was fixed last year and see that I have a warranty. Call them up and they say take it to this shop. I do that yesterday. Guy calls me back saying bad news‚Ä¶ engine is toast. Something about a gasket needing to be replaced and that a new engine would probably be around the same price. Recommended I start car shopping. Talk to a friend about it and they are confused as to why the engine would need to be replaced if I can still drive the vehicle somewhat normally up until 40MPH. I am completely ignorant when it comes to cars so I have no idea what it could be. I also find it weird that it starts fine and can drive pretty decent if I‚Äôm pressing the gas lightly if the engine is completely shot. Do any of you have any idea what could be happening? Would you recommend I try to find another shop to diagnose it? What‚Äôs an acceptable diagnostics fee these days? I appreciate your help!",

That being said, I am NOT an attorney, and this is not specific legal advice as I am not legally qualified to give that. Just some general things to do if you are in a situation like this. I've also had a couple of family members over the years that have had similar issues. One who didn't read the contract, and the other where fraud was committed. Also, I don't live in Texas, but I did spend a couple of minutes looking up their title fraud laws (I live in Iowa, we have similar laws). So here it goes... Okay, time to pull out that paperwork you signed at the dealership. Does it say on the paperwork ANYWHERE that the vehicle has a salvage title, prior salvage, or rebuilt.? If so, you probably don't have much in the way of legal options. Now, IF the dealer sold you a vehicle without disclosing that it had a salvage, rebuilt, etc title, you do have some options. IF this is the case, the dealership in question may have committed dealer fraud under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). I say IF, because many times when things like this occur, the purchaser did not read the paperwork thoroughly before signing (which is a tactic shitty dealers use on purpose. They wear you down in the financial office and most people just want to sign so they can get out of there). If it appears that this is fraud, here's what you do: 1. Gather all documentation. (Basically, if it isn't in writing, in most states, you have no standing). 2. Contact the dealership. State that the vehicle was sold without disclosing the issues, and that you would like a full refund. If they are unwilling to do that, you are going to report them to the Texas DMV. Make sure to act professionally, and in writing as well as verbally. If it isn't in writing, it didn't happen. Remember that. 3. When the dealership refuses (they probably will, because if they are as shitty as you say, they knowing fucked you over), report them to the Texas DMV. Provide the person handling your case with all of your documentation. Make sure all communication with the dealership is in writing. Even better, record your phone calls (Texas is a one-party recording state, so this is completely legal to do without their consent or notification). Have all of this ready when reporting. 4. Be prepared to file a complaint with the Texas Attorney general and also consider seeking legal counsel. If you have evidence that fraud has been committed, and the dealership is found liable, they will likely be responsible for making you whole (most likely, refunding the price of the vehicle) and pay any court and attorney fees. You need to be prepared for a fight. This is going to be a long process. But IF fraud was committed, and you have documentation to prove it, you will likely get some relief. Also, your statute of limitations is 24 months from the time of purchase, so you'd better get on this quick. Also, I would cross post this in /legaladvice. That's where lawyers hang out. And the questions aren't answered by average joes. But by attorneys. You get banned real fast from that subreddit if you are someone like me who is not a licensed attorney and try to answer legal questions. I'm glad they do that because there is a big difference in \"knowing some things\" and being a practicing attorney that works daily on shit like this.",

I took it into the shop recently due to the engine being a bit louder, the previous mechanic mentioned the fuel tank was stained, and the check engine light came on, so I wanted to get it fully checked out. The damage was: 1. The fuel tank was rotted pretty bad and needed to be replaced, quoted $1000 to fix it 2. The high and low power steering lines were \"leaking\" (i've had no power steering issues and a mechanic buddy came by and had a brief look and said that they really didn't look that bad) and very crusty. Quoted $800 for it. 3. The knock sensor is what tripped the check engine light, quoted $250 to fix that. 4. The noise from my engine was the exhaust. Two flanges are fairly bad and should be replaced soon, the third flange is very bad and should be replaced. $600. After taxes and labour and all that, apparently looking around 3k in total, which the car probably isn't worth much more than that to be honest.

There have been times when it stalls while coming to a full stop (eg roundabout) and I have to give it gas to keep the engine on. Otherwise the revs drop to 0 and the engine shuts off. I am able to switch the engine on just fine after stalling. It's just been for a full service and he put fuel injector cleaner to see if it would help. Mechanic said can't really know whats wrong at the moment due to no warning lights or diagnostic codes... but it is still idling weird even after that. I'm not sure about how serious it could be but are there any ideas on what I should do, or should I wait until it's more clear what's causing it etc? Any help would be appreciated, TIA",

    "selftext": "I'm an armchair car enthusiast, and I'm wondering if my case is unique or not. I had this enthusiasm for cars since childhood, going from toys and collecting car figures to reading and watching everything about specific car models online, on YouTube, Reddit, etc. There's just literally so much stuff I've read and watched about cars, it's hard to describe. But the thing is that I'm a young guy, and I've never had a car ever. I also don't have a stable high-income job, but I have been freelancing and sort of digital nomading for a while. I'm working on building a stable high-income career right now though. And unlike many youngsters today, I'd love to have my own car somewhere someday. I'd love to have the freedom to drive anywhere I want in my own private vehicle at any moment. I've been fantasizing about that for a while. And while choosing which car I'd like to own as my first or my main and only car, I've faced this strange paradox. In the beginning, I've been thinking how I'd love to own some old Merc (W123, W124, W201) or old BMW (E30), and I thought that I'd love repairing them DIY, because I'm somewhat mechanically inclined. But then I realized that with all the stuff in my life, all the hobbies and activities... I've realized that while I have some real passion for cars, I love to read and watch everything about them, actually going and fixing an old car, or any car whatsoever, spending days and hours of my life on that - is the last thing I'd ever want to do. There are two reasons for that: 1. I'm kind of lazy 2. There's always so much stuff in real life that is worth your attention, whether it's watching a movie, reading a book, spending time with your family, improvising some melody while playing guitar/piano, or learning something new about coding/programming. There's just never enough time for everything. I'm also not the person who likes to change things often. I'm thinking I'm that type of person who'd love to own and drive the same car for 10-20 years. So I've realized that some Toyota Corolla E120 (9th gen) would be a perfect car for me. I literally need a car-cockroach that will run forever with regular maintenance, and it's not going to break too often, and it's not going to be too expensive.",

My concern is that if I were to buy some older German car, like Merc or BMW, moving forward the next 5-10 or more years, it would take a lot of time working on it DIY. The older they get = the more things to break. And it‚Äôs not like I wouldn‚Äôt want to spend this time working on the car. But that would mean I have to manage my time differently. That would mean I‚Äôd spend less time on other things, whether it‚Äôs sleeping, resting, watching a movie, spending time with family, writing music, or learning programming, anything. And from that point of view, it makes sense to choose the car that would take the least of my time repairing it, meaning owning the most reliable car, like a Corolla/Camry or Honda Civic/Accord. I think it‚Äôs kind of amazing on its own that there are tons of 20+ years old Corollas on the roads, and in the next 20-30 years, there still will be plenty of them on the roads.

When I start the car, the glow plug warning light begins blinking, not staying on constantly but actually flashing. During this period, I also notice a loss of engine power. After about 10 to 15 minutes, the glow plug light turns off and the check engine light appears. Interestingly, after driving for a while, even the check engine light goes away on its own. The error code I get is P2564, which relates to the turbocharger boost control position sensor. I took the car to a turbocharger specialist who had a quick look and said the turbo itself is probably not the issue. Another workshop, however, claimed that the turbo needs to be replaced. From what I‚Äôve read in various forums, I‚Äôm leaning toward it being an issue with the wiring or the sensor itself. Many people mentioned that the fault persisted even after replacing the turbocharger, which makes me think the problem lies elsewhere. Also, whenever the glow plug light is not blinking, the car performs with full power. The issue started when the weather got colder, and I never experienced it during warmer conditions. That‚Äôs another reason why I suspect it could be a wiring or sensor issue affected by temperature.",

After performing a smoke test on the evap system (.020 size leak) I found the leak on top of the fuel tank (right side rear) coming from a molded port on the fuel tank. The port is cracked all the way through. The proper way to fix this is to replace the fuel tank. So if you're running into this issue with a P0456 on your mustang this may be the cause. I got the fuel tank today and the tank strap bolts (TP50) need to be heated up with an inductive heater to soften the loctite or good luck getting them out. Hope this helps if you're mustang has this issue.",

Did a lot of work and finally got the engine to run and stay running! kind of. The issue is the carb is not getting enough gas. I replaced the rubber fuel line parts but the majority of the fuel lines are steel. They are insanely clogged and im not sure exactly how to unclog them at this point im thinking a long ass pipe cleaner or something i could find on amazon. I dont want to use fuel additives just because I dont think they would actually help unclog it since its so gunked up and barely any fuel is getting to the carb. Any advise or tips. Dont really want to re-do the steel lines but I will if I have to. (I should note thatt yes I have replaced the mechanical fuel pump , fuel filter, and other fuel parts its just this damn clog.)",

Since then it has been in limp mode. I decided to change the oil even though it‚Äôs only been about 2,000 miles since the last oil change. The oil was in acceptable range. My coolant however was suspiciously low. Filled it up. Ended up needing a new battery so I got that. And now I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôve checked all of my fuses, replace one unimportant one that happened to be bad, I‚Äôve meticulously looked through wiring, hoses, MAS airflow sense, checked transmission oil. The weird thing is the engine isn‚Äôt sending any codes, I confirmed this with two of my readers and a local shop‚Äôs reader. At this point I have no clue where to look other than replacing random things until it fixes the issue. I do worry I may need a new ECU all together. Any thoughts on where to go from here??

My mechanic was able to reroute the coolant using a bypass method away from the throttle body so coolant doesn't flow through the throttle body anymore and leak into it causing the issues. He said the car has been driving fine since he did this. My question is there any long term damage that can be done doing this and is there any long term damage in not fixing the gasket issue if coolant is not flowing into it?

I didn‚Äôt go fast at all (50 km/h or 30 mph) but suddenly the roll-bar popped up while the roof was down, I know this is a safety feature but it didn‚Äôt want to go down anymore. I drove home and decided to open the roof and hope that, that would trigger the system into thinking that the roll-bar could be closed. As you guessed it, it didn‚Äôt work. Matter fact it got worse. I tried to close the roof and everything closed except for the trunk. It was still up and wouldn‚Äôt go down anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do now. I‚Äôve tried various solutions such as holding the roll-bar up button (saw this solution to stop the emergency system), I tried pressing down the pins in the roll-bar spring system, disconnected the hydrologic oil, checked the fuses and I tried to reopen the roof with the key (holding the close button for 15 seconds to either open the roof or take out the hydrologic system. Now the trunk could be lowered but not closed due to the interior trims not being retracted). Now I‚Äôm stuck with a trunk thats open for about 15cm, a stuck roll-bar and a roof that doesn‚Äôt respond. Ps. there is enough hydrologic oil in the tank, because I recently refilled it. Not like I can fill it up now tho, but it‚Äôs worth mentioning. Anyone who‚Äôs got a tip, solution or anything that would help? Thanks. Kind regards this SL350 owner",

Yes, it is possible to retrofit the headlight assemblies to add proper optics for an LED light source/driver. There's a whole cottage industry around doing proper LED retrofits (as opposed to drop-ins, which as you've already been told, are terrible, and in some jurisdictions, illegal). But honestly? It's still a waste of time. Modern cars have adequate headlights. The brightness war has not made night driving safer. Focus your energy on learning to take on your own maintenance, which will save you a lot of money and give you more pride in ownership than brighter lights. If you think, nah it already runs fine... there's always more maintenance to do. How old is the DSG fluid? The brake fluid? Have you greased the door pins?

Here‚Äôs the list of things that‚Äôs been done: Replaced drum brake shoes (due to uneven wear) Bleed brakes manually via bleeder screws Bleed brakes via scantool and ABS Replaced brake master cylinder Replaced brake fluid Replaced brake booster vacuum hose Other things that has been checked: Rotors and brake pads are good Calipers are not stuck No sign of external leaks No fault codes No leaks in wheel cylinder Other things that have been noticed in the brakes: -Rusty brake dust on the drums -Weird sound when the brake pedal is pushed when the car is idle (it‚Äôs like a squeaky sound when the shoes are making contact with the drum) - this one came off after the parking brake was adjusted I‚Äôve already asked local shops and have it checked multiple times but they can‚Äôt pinpoint the exact problem. Majority says it was a bad master cylinder so I had it replaced but it didn‚Äôt fixed my problem. Now, someone adviced me to replace my wheel cylinders because there‚Äôs a weird noise coming from both sides of the rear brakes when the pedal is pushed when the car is idle but there are no leaks coming from the cylinders. Someone also said that it could be a bad booster, however, the pedal is not hard and the symptom is quite the opposite for a bad booster. My brakes are not completely lost and I can still drive my car but with extra care and I need to do extra pumps to get a full stop. I wanna get it fixed really bad so any help would be much appreciated. üò≠",

        "body": "Just throwing in my 2c here. Spongy brakes can be multiple symptoms, and considering a vast majority of the actual braking force is handled via the front, I would actually shift focus on that end rather than possibly chase the rear drums. Wouldn't hurt to actually do a proper inspection of the front rotors themselves to ensure they haven't glazed over, thus severely harming the rotors effectiveness. I would also check the front pads themselves while you're at it to ensure you haven't actually overcooked those either. Considering you described that you need to get extra pumps and that it isn't a hard pedal but a decisively soft one, I would also recommend doing a proper drain and fill of the brake fluid entirely rather than a simple corner bleed, ideally with something like a power bleeder. Finally, 2011 vehicle means that age is definitely a real concern, and you could also have a very real possibility of your brake lines themselves are shot internally and are flexing/deforming. --- I do want to also state that I am not a mechanic, just somebody who DIY's their own shit and runs their car hard, so I'm thinking of the typical performance side of spongy (soft) brake pedal. Even for a performance car, once you glaze over the rotors or cook the brake fluid, the pedal is going to feel like shit even with stainless lines. Factor in that something like your Hyundai will have vastly smaller rotors with a more economy focused brake pad, and even a few aggressive 70-20 stops back2back2back can risk glazing them over.",

A year ago I traded the car in because i moved to a colder climate that has snow and ice and also wanted something more practical. So I found myself in Golf R. Don't get me wrong, this car is Fun! Extremely practical, fun easy to drive and move around and can SEE out of it. Now I'm moving back to a warm climate again and as fun as the R is, it's not the same as the SS was. The sneeze whiz bang pops for the Ea888, is nothing vs the Vulgar Yelling and manual gear switching of the LT1 V8 from the SS 1LE. Thing is I found a duplicate of my old 1LE and it's bit me to want to go get it. The reason for this post, is I have a car bucket list and a few of those cars are also available. Like an Ram SRT10, Terminator, Mustang, New Pontiac GTO, CTS-V1. With the Camaro I fell like I didn't do all the things I wanted to wich was track it a few times like I had planned.

Also, possibly unrelated, for years my car has made this sort of gurgling/hissing noise like steam/pressure or something building up and then releasing before it builds up again and then releases on repeat.

I'm looking at $400 for the best non-power coat solution, which I'm told will only last for a few years. I'm considering just spraying some Dupli-Color myself. My first question is, if I do it myself, do I absolutely have to sand blast them first, or can I just spray it on top? Secondly, how long before it chips and becomes visible ugly again. Would applying some ceramic coating on top of the Dupli-Color make it last significantly longer? Any advice and other considerations are greatly appreciated.",

    "selftext": "#Edit: Code is P0301, I'm a dummy. For background the battery in my girlfriends 2016 CRV died in October. She replaced it with a non oem battery. A couple of months ago she woke up and the check engine, power steering, tire pressure, and traction control lights were on additionally she noticed that cylinder 1 was misfiring. She consulted with a friend of hers and decided to replace the coil packs. On the way to Auto Zone she noticed that the lights had gone out, but the cylinder was still misfiring. She replaced the coil packs and nothing changed. About a month later she took the car to her dad, and he realized that when they installed the replacement battery they did so with the bracket touching the battery terminal. He ratcheted back the bracket, and instantly the misfiring stopped. A few days later she started the car in the morning and the cylinder was misfiring again, as well as the 3 error lights coming back on. At this point she replaced the battery again, this time with an oem one, and once again the cylinder stopped misfiring, and the error codes disappeared. A few days later the same issues started happening again. The she tried disconnecting and reseating the battery, which once again cleared the issue, only for it to start happening again a few days later. Today she disconnected the battery and reconnected it, and the issue disappeared again, but for obvious reasons we suspect it will come back in the next few days. Things she has tried: Replaced battery (twice), coil packs, spark plugs. She has had two scans run and the only error being thrown is cylinder 1 misfire. Electrical diagnostic at auto zone showed no error with battery or alternator. She is now being advised to treat it as a cylinder issue, not as an electrical system issue. This doesn't really jive with things that I've read, but I'm obviously not the expert, so I'm 100% willing to be wrong here.j I'm not much of a car guy, so if I relayed any of this information in a way that doesn't make sense please let me know, but she's really pulling her hair out over this, any help would be appreciated.",

Driving on the highway, battery saver mode came on and the battery was draining big time. Managed to get it to a garage. They said it would be a new alternator. Fine. Collected it later that week. Literally a week later the EXACT same thing happened, only this time closer to home. Took it to a garage I trust and they‚Äôve told me I got screwed by the other garage (who fitted the alternator) as they‚Äôd put one in that wasn‚Äôt powerful enough for the beastly Traverse. So the garage I trust is putting in a new one - but what on earth do I do about the $1100+ I‚Äôve shelled out for a part that a) wasn‚Äôt fit for purpose and b) didn‚Äôt last a week!? EDIT - For those asking, the invoice states it was a Duralast Alternator DL5602-6-1, which Autozone recommends. But that is at a disconnect with what the new garage is stating. Intent is to request my money back from the garage who did the fitting. If not, small claims court could be in my future!",

Work Order #12345. Well I've got a bit of a situation. The alternator that was installed on my vehicle at your shop quit working after about 5 hours of driving. Fortunately I was not far from my usual garage and managed to limp it there so there's no tow truck involved. I paid to have it inspected and they found the new alternator has no output but interestingly they believe it's undersized alternator? Too small for this application? I'm not sure. It's entirely possible you were sent the wrong alternator but it physically fit and the tech just went ahead and installed it because it was working. I've already had the vehicle repaired at my cost again so I'm need to get the invoice refunded and get this now-inoperable alternator back to you. I'll also include a copy of my invoice from here so you can make a claim against your part supplier for the labor that's lost, if you need it.\" It'd be nice to add the lines \"Your guys did fine, there were no lose bolts or installation errors - it's just the wrong alternator and it shit the bed.\"",

I had similar issue, when it could lock, but only when key is in 0 position (it still must not lock the wheel until keys sre ibside). Try to reproduse yhe issue without moving, just on the idle. The best way to fix it is a lock replacement. Contacts can be reviewed and cleaned/fixed most probably. But it also may be caues by two issues at the same time. First issue may be related to the fuel system. Try to analyze - how much fuel is in the tank? I heard about such issue on some cars made for US (or not only for US), when on the right turn engine stalled because fuel pump got air, there were not much fuel in the tank and on the turn it moved left. Theoretically it also may be caused by moving parts during the turn. Something may press on the fuel hose somewhere u der the hood and it causes engine stall. Chances are low, but should be checked easily. And steering wheel issue still caused by ignition lock.",

Most of the noise seems to be coming from the front half of the car rather than the back half, and I‚Äôve also noticed that very rarely when I take turns, my car will suddenly have a quick kick to it, like a slight boost. Not sure if that‚Äôs normal or if I‚Äôm taking turnings too quickly somehow, that‚Äôs less of my concern but just something else I noticed that very rarely happens, but the noise is very much consistent the entire time my car is driving now.

        "body": "Okay, I saw the other post the other day. My mom also drove an 06 Corolla that she bought new, until about last week. Her commute since I was 11 years old in 06 was 45 minutes/54 miles one way, 108 miles a day. A total of 580k miles just for work since she bought it. She hit the odometer limit of 299999 when I was in highschool, in 2012. She kept loose track of her mileage and I'm pretty sure it's over a million miles now. I finally convinced her last week to replace it(she has been driving back and forth every other weekend to take care of my uncle in another state 4 hours away). I just didn't want her to get stuck on i70 between Indiana and Ohio where my dad and I would have to go pick her up in the middle of the night, and search for whatever mile marker she got stuck at. About a year ago I replaced her battery and alternator(original alternator). Half a year ago I replaced the rear shocks(they were the factory shocks). The rear top hat on the drivers side snapped from rusting through, so I swapped both in the rear. I then replaced the brakes a month later, front were okay but rear shoes were factory shoes with the paint marks. When I did the brakes and shocks I looked at the underside and it was similar but wayyyyy worse. Main concern would be water getting into the roof. My moms quarters were gone, the side rails were starting to crumble, doors rusting on the lower corners, subframe/control arms weren't too bad but you could tell it wasn't surface rust anymore. Well 2 weeks ago she ran over a tractor recap on the interstate, two days later her exhaust blew out and she said it was loud. I had to tell her that her car is so rusty that once I pull a piece of the exhaust off, it'd be likely that I have to replace every connecting exhaust piece up to the head. That was the point she finally decided to go replace the car. The engine is still halfway decent, I haven't ran compression tests or anything, but it just smokes a little at high rpm and is a little down on power. But that's it. She now still drives it around town only. TLDR; mom has a million mile Corolla from 06 that she finally replaced for her daily 108 mile work commute.",

Price is firm, no trades. Questions: ‚Ä¢ How concerned should I be about the rebuilt title? ‚Ä¢ What else should I be checking before buying this car? ‚Ä¢ Anything on the repair list raise red flags? ‚Ä¢ Are there common issues with 2007 Civic Sis I should know about? Appreciate any insight‚Äîreally don‚Äôt want to get in over my head here. Thanks in advance!",

So maybe you should start to see yourself as the one who is going to look after her car, because she obviously won't. Go a step further, and buy some tools. Good ones. Start doing your oil changes, brakes, rotating tires. I assume you don't do any of those things already, because, if you did, you would have already been checking her car for her.

The tire is so worn out that not only can see the steel frame the tread has, but some of the layers on the right side are even completely cut off, which is a very big red flag that you need new tires. Also, that tire wear on the right side NEEDS to be corrected for the next set, you should have a nice and flat wear pattern across the entire width of the tire, not something like this. For reference, there are these little bumps on the outskirts on the tread, should have a straight line through it, and there all over the outer edge of the tire. Once it hits those, that‚Äôs when you need to get new tires because otherwise you risk damaging the internals of the tire itself.",

Couple weeks later I saw her car all jacked and asked what happened, she says the next day after that convo it blew up doin highway speeds and she felt so stupid she was too embarrassed to tell me üòÇ. I asked how much money she's saved by not doing that lol I just had to mess with her lol",
