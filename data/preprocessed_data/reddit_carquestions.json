    "selftext": "Hi all, Looking for some advice because I’m stuck without a car and getting mixed signals. I had a new clutch installed recently, and now I’m experiencing a serious issue: when I press the clutch pedal fully down, it doesn’t come back up on its own. I have to physically hook my foot under it and pull it up. Because of this, I wasn’t able to drive my car today. I messaged the mechanic, and he said this is “completely normal for a new clutch” and that it needs to bed in, mentioning something about the spring needing around 300 presses to settle. He insists that the hydraulics are fine and that this is part of the mechanical system breaking in. But something feels off. I’ve never heard of a new clutch needing that kind of “break-in” just to return the pedal to its neutral position. I always thought break-in affects friction feel, not whether the pedal physically works. Question: Has anyone here dealt with this? Is there any case where a new clutch install would cause the pedal not to return, and that’s “normal”? Or is this likely an install fault? Thanks in advance.",

Revving the engine puts torque on the drivetrain between the rear wheels and the transmission. The rear axle is mounted on leaf springs which deform, allowing the axle’s position to twist backward, raising the nose of the car. Backing off the throttle reduces/removes the torque, everything returns to normal position. Revving and releasing repeatedly causes the up and down. Engines are mounted front-to-back so torque will cause the engine to attempt to rotate in the opposite direction which tends to twist the body of the car and raise the front left corner. In neutral or park, simply revving a powerful engine may be enough to cause side-to-side roll and return. With most front wheel drive cars the engine is oriented side-to-side and the torque, when in gear and standing on the brakes and revving, is entirely front-to-back and tends to pull the nose down but not side-to-side. Modern rear wheel drive cars have trailing arm suspensions that, unlike lead springs, don’t twist when torque is applied. The axle is securely mounted on the end of what is effectively a hinge with a spring between it and the body providing the suspension.",

Assuming the car hasn’t been beaten to death and it has a 1.8 or 2.0 it’s an excellent platform. Parts are readily available because VAG has put the same driveline in like 4 billion cars over the last 15 years. Any mechanic will be familiar with working on them and it should be reasonably reliable. Miles are low but it’s old enough to start developing random vacuum, coolant, etc leaks like any vehicle as the rubber and plastic ages. You need the timing belt changed before it hits 80k. You can probably safely push this out to 100k but I wouldn’t risk it. It will cost $900-1200. Ignoring this WILL destroy the engine. Many people put catch cans on these vehicles for reliability, it is a worthwhile modification and will keep your intake manifold and valves cleaner. No idea what you’re talking about with the brakes.

I love my car, its pretty reliable, but they are expensive to repair if you pay a shop. I’m having a shop replace my water pump right now because the thermostat failed, and it costs $1200. The water pump is buried, so its a long job. The good news is, when these thermostats fail, they stick open, so at least the car doesnt overheat, and you can technically drive it, though it will cause problems long term from the engine not getting up to temp. I have replaced my front brakes myself, but the rear ones are tricky due to the electronic parking brake. Still doing research myself, believe you have to put the car in service mode, or have some special computer to release the parking brake. There is also a way to remove the parking brake without damaging it so that you can replace the rear pads, but it is a bit of extra work. I also monitor my timing chain, since my year had issues with the timing chain tensioner. It is an expensive job to replace the timing chain, but if it gets too loose from slack over time, it can blow your engine. Are you fairly mechanically inclined? I can do basic stuff, but I got an OBD11 device for $90, it allows me to check a ton of stuff. I got it because: 1. I needed an obd scanner anyways, 2. I wanted to monitor my timing chain slack, and 3. I wanted to keep track of other stats so that I could diagnose future issues and hopefully prevent issues before they get bad/ fail Overall, I think you might have overpaid a bit, but I dont think it was a terrible deal overall",

Now it’s starting to do it more often and it feels like it’s getting a little bit more aggressive. What could be the cause? Is it a wheel alignment that I need? I plan to call discount tires tomorrow morning as Thursday would be a week from when I got the new tires. Whatever needs to be done. I’m hoping it’s free.😬😂",

Current Quick Options are years 2022-2025: M4 Comps and other M models C63 AMG LC 500 RCF IS500 The overall goal is with depreciation these vehicles will fall more within my budget. I currently make around 100k gross and will ofc be buying these vehicles used. I do not have kids, I’m young, currently investing about 20% (with company contributions) into a 401k and 7% into a Roth. I rent as of now and have about 5k in CC debt. I do not plan on buying a home in the next 3-5 years because my job location changes (construction field). I currently rent I’m planning on following the 20/4/10 rule to correctly budget and save for said vehicles. Are there any other things I should consider before purchasing a car?

Jesus Christ in Poland average car is 14-16 years old with meat those are from around 2010. if it wasn't for my big accident ‘16 where firefighters had to cut open the car and I got a prosthetic knee I would still drive my Fiat Punto '92. My other car Nissan Tiida '08 mechanically perfect only with dead AC (common issue for this model) was stolen around '21. If not that I would not buy a newer car. A Polish proverb says clearly: Jak dbasz, tak masz -> if you take care of it, you have it. Older cars are much easier to work with it. Sometime you can have problem finding new parts but after few hours and some calls everything can be found. The Punto very rarely broke down, I did most of the repairs, but the workshop also came out cheap. Parts were always available. The only disadvantage was the rust of the chassis Tiida had it a little worse because the air conditioning was constantly broken and once a summer season she went to the workshop. Repairs were more expensive, but there was no disaster. The worst with the parts were Rear breakes discs drums were impossible to get. It was a big problem because it was not a popular car in Poland and parts from the much more popular Note did not fit. Routine checks are the most important. The car will usually show that something hurts it, so keep an eye on the tires, oil and brakes.",

I know I will need to replace all the filters including the cabin filter and air filters. Do I need any of the following? If not now, when should I plan on doing these? Engine oil flush Coolant flush Transmission fluid flush Power steering fluid flush Brake fluid flush I'm not sure if the dealer did these while my car was under warranty but I would assume the car needs all this at some point soon since it's over 50-60K in miles.",

And a pair of pretty nice binoculars that were hidden under the rear seats were just sitting in the driver seat, but also not stolen. We obviously lock our cars, but I’m pretty sure I forgot yesterday evening when I was unloading groceries, which is when everything in mine was shifted around. But no windows have been broken, so someone was obviously in them when we forgot to lock them (dumb, I know). I’m racking my brain trying to figure out what the point of this could be. Is it possible someone can try to somehow make a key to come back and steal them if they get inside? I don’t think anyone broke in to sleep because it didn’t smell at all.",

Given the small amount of damage and it being purely cosmetic I was surprised to learn that the quote for parts was $770 and the quote for labor was $1255: I do no know the make and model but it still feels unreasonable. The owner went to the Mercedes-Benz dealer to get the quote. The pieces needed are: -Carrier -Grill center star -Bumper area cover -Bumper Moulding All of the prices listed on the quote are in total almost $500 dollars inflated compared to the Mercedes-Benz online store. Is there anything I can ask of the owner, like going to another shop? Or am I just screwed?",

Most of my expenses go to ubering there and back usually four times a week. The thing is, I’m going to be fully financial over said car as my parents refuse to add any help whatsoever, in which I’m not complaining. They suggest I should buy from Facebook marketplace as I wouldn’t able to handle the finances that come from financing a car. The thing I don’t like about their suggestion is that it is very rare, one in a million, to find a good car that is within the price range of $1000-$2000. Most of the cars either have rust, broken down parts that will cost even more money to repair or replace, or above 200k miles. My problem is that I don’t want to then have to expect to throw out the car after or less then 5 years in which my parents argue “why go out for your first car, it just needs to get you from point A to point B”. I understand their argument to some extent, but I argue back that I want a more reliable car in which I shouldn’t expect many problems with in regards to my safety and won’t want to throw out until after 10. What I wanted to ask was should I finance a car that would be a max of $10,000 in which I would put a down payment of around $1000-$2000–monthly payment would be around $150–or continuing to look on Facebook marketplace or Craigslist? P.S. -I have no other relatives to contact -My mother is also worried about the car insurance that comes with financing a car -There are no changes I can make job wise",

    "selftext": "While driving my 2014 GMC Sierra 1500 with the 5.3L (approx. 159,000 mi), the engine started acting like it was starving for power, with RPMs dropping or not responding for a few moments when pressing on the gas pedal. After a short bit, the check engine light turned on. I always have my scanner with me, so I pulled off and checked the codes, and I had one--P0106. I wasn't able to stop driving immediately, and by the time I got home and checked again I had P0106, P0107, and P3400. I tested the MAP wires and got a solid 5V. Back testing with the sensor removed from its housing, I was getting 1.18V at idle, so I replaced the MAP sensor. Back tested and still got 1.18V with the new one and it showed 9.8 inHg when idling. So, I cleared the codes and went for a test drive. It shortly developed the same issue, but now I'm getting P0106, P0420, and P0430. I didn’t want to, but had to drive it to get some tools and now I have a misfire cylinder one error code on top of everything else. I doubt this has an impact, but just in case, three weeks ago I had a shop replace some AC lines that were leaking. Two weeks ago, I did a home flush (distilled water only, no chemicals) and replacement of the coolant, thermostat and coolant temperature sensor due to not getting up to temperature and the fan running non-stop as soon as you started the vehicle. Any thoughts or next steps on figuring out what is going on to cause these issues? Thank you in advance!",

    "selftext": "I'm currently driving my first car for the past year which is a 2007 BMW 318i e90 2.0 Petrol that is on it's last legs. I'll soon be switching to a 2016-2018 Lexus IS300H F-Sport 2.5 Petrol/Hybrid. Would there be much difference in power especially when accelerating? When driving up any inclines the 318i barely builds speed, will this still be an annoyance in the Lexus? What other pros does the Lexus have for example MPG, reliability, repairs, resale value in a few years?",

There's a pin that's supposed to lock them in place when the car is off, but it gets stuck and doesn't lock them, so they rattle and bang around like crazy until oil pressure builds up. Probably something similar. Get them replaced or you'll end up ruining your engine if they break completely. My guess is that you'll have to basically do a timing belt job to get them off so it won't be cheap, but in today's car market it's probably well worth it.",

    "selftext": "I’m sorry to be bothering anyone currently reading this, I just need genuine and realistic opinions. I’m currently a 17 year old male, attempting to get their first car before the start of senior year. Here’s my situation, I’m fully responsible financially for the car with no help from my parents whatsoever. I’m currently working a retail job with a minimum pay in which is $15/hourly and get paid every friday. I usually rack around $150-$200 per week so around $600-$800 per month, give or take. I currently get around from home to my job with the ride app UBER in which is usually $20-$25 each time so the saving up journey is rough. My parents suggest getting a car off of Facebook marketplace for $1,500. Here’s the thing, I don’t fully understand as to why they won’t let me finance a car exactly. Because I will be putting a $1000-$2000 down payment on a used car that costs a max of $10,000, will obviously choose the cheaper option then $10,000 but that is the max. So finance options, in which i researched, what be around $150 a month. But they say I wouldn’t be able to steadily afford it monthly because of car insurance and gas. Now I’m not fully sure how much car insurance will be because I don’t know if they’re going to have me go under theirs and I pay them for it monthly or have me go completely on my own in which I know is expensive either way in which they told me would be $200. I just want an opinion on if my parents are being protective over this and if I’m not fully grasping how much money I would be spending on this car monthly, my only problem with buying a car off of Facebook marketplace is that unless you find one in a million, most of the cars are run dry to around 200,000k miles with problems that need to be fix that cost more money which I feel like I would end up having to scrap the car in the next 5 years while if I finance one that is completely clean and will not be getting rid of probably until the next 10 years. I’ve been looking in places like CARFAX and cars.com, etc. I can’t tell genuinely if I’m being delusional or stupid about this, I’m just not big into exactly how car details work but please lemme know your opinions and sorry if this question was all over the place!",

Right now is a great time to get a loan because percentage rates are going down. You will more than likely need a co-signer. Your parents' credit is affected by that negatively initially. But if you pay your car on time it will increase their credit and yours. Please get a pre approved auto loan from a bank. I think $10,000 is perfectly manageable with your income.

You're not gong to be able to pay for every needed repair done at a shop on your income. You need to be able to fix some things yourself. $150-$200 a week at $15 an hour implies you're working two days a week. Is that right? So if you make two trips to work a week at $25 each that's $50. You say your insurance is $200, IOW, $50 a week. So you've used up all the money you save on Uber on insurance and still haven't paid for the car, repairs, or gas. Forget the car.

    "selftext": "I have three different noise that I hate that I’m hearing in my car, but my mechanic swears the car is perfectly fine and will last me another 100K miles (it won’t, I’ll say why at the end). 1st is somewhat of a chain rattle. Originally only happened when it was very cold outside, now it happens anytime I accelerate. I assume is Chain Tensioner, mechanic says it’s not urgent to fix it yet, to call back in a few weeks if it persists. 2nd noise is a small knock noise that doesn’t necessarily sound like a misfire. I did a tuneup recently so plugs and boot are new, no CEL or codes. Not sure what it is, mechanic claims it’s old Toyota noise, I agreed, but I’ve heard 250K corollas sound better than mine lol. 3rd noise is more of a feeling. I constantly feel like my tire has rocks in it or like the suspension is wobbly while driving, I only hear it inside so I guess it’s subtle, but it’s annoying and reminds me of when I had loose lug nuts. Also,I installed brand new brake shoes and drums (Centrics brand), and I hear a very loud screech, mechanic says brakes need to break in, I’ve never changed the rear so I have no clue. Anyone have insight on the noise, what to fix or not fix, should I just chill out and listen to mechanic? He’s never tried to take my money, if anything if tries to keep me from going too much. I’ll accept any downvotes that come from the annoyingly long post. PS: I don’t think car will last 100K because there’s rust under the spare wheel, I found a puddle of water months after a very rainy day, I guess the trunk wasn’t properly sealed and it all puddled down there… if anyone knows how to fix lmk.",

A 4banger s10 may get good MPG, but it's going to suck if you need to do truck stuff. A 6.9/7.3 F350 is going to cost more on fuel, but it'll pull a trailer without thinking about it (won't do it fast, but it'll do it until the world ends) and you can toss the S10 in the bed.

I've always had an interest in wanting a miata, but I need some help. 1. I don't know what year or model I want, I dont know where the best place to go to find the best reliable information 2. I definitely know the easiest way to learn is hands on learning, but I need a place to start to get the car in the first place, I need to know best places to get parts if I decide I want more of a project car. 3. I know there's always youtube videos for everything out there, I just need help getting the ground solid of information and resources before I just dive into something. I know I love cars and have always wanted to learn about them, and I think having a miata would just be so fun and cool, I just love the way they look. I just dont know much about the history, or the car itself or how many different types they're are and I want to do it justice and know more about it before just buying the car \"cus it looks cool\". Thank you in advance, I so can't wait to own this car and I'm ready to start my journey!!",

    "selftext": "I attempted to trade in my 2017 Honda Ridgeline last week and was made aware that it has an NAM/Branded title. The dealership let me know they were going to give me $14k for it initially. However because of the title sitch they found on CarFax, they’d only be able to give me $7k. Naturally I opted out of the purchase I was going to make as I was completely unaware of the title status. I bought the Ridgeline 11/6/2021 from a larger dealership with multiple locations. As I investigated the chain of custody of the car, I realized that on 10/29/2021 another location of the dealership sold it to the dealership I bought it from. When transferring the title between dealerships, an employee fat fingered the mileage of the Ridgeline and submitted to the state. When I bought the car it was never disclosed that there was an issue with the title - I’m assuming there’s no way they would’ve known yet. The DMV confirmed this chain of events with me yesterday. I was advised that there was nothing I could do to remedy the situation since I didn’t execute any of this, and that the dealership would need to submit a request to get the title corrected. I called the dealership immediately after and they’ve actually been very compliant. They did however claim that they were never made aware by the DMV that there was and error and that the DMV made a mileage exemption to the car when it was transferred between dealerships. We talked to my lienholder (TD auto) separately. TD let me know the dealership would need to submit the title change request and letter for them to surrender the title to make this happen. The dealership was advised that the title they have for the Ridgeline is clean with no NAM or mileage exemption indicated. AND mileage on the title apparently shows what it was when I purchased it so they don’t know why they need to hand over the title. The dealership let me know they submitted the correction paperwork and letter to TD Auto regardless so they can collectively work on correction. I’m going to follow up with both groups in the morning to see where we’re at. Long winded I know, but I’m trying to understand next steps if the title correction process isn’t smooth and what leverage I have with the dealership for their clerical error that could cost me thousands. I ultimately feel that this is completely out of my control and am worried that tomorrow might turn into a finger pointing game when I start circling wagons between the dealership, DMV, and TD Auto. Appreciate any thoughts in advance of anyone’s experience in resolving a similar issue. Also, I live in Illinois if that’s important!",

He says it drives just fine and is not noticeable but the relevant engine lights come on occasionally. He had replaced them with aftermarket ones about 6 months ago and was going well at first but after a couple months the engine lights started coming back on. The car mainly is driven short distance and the most it gets driven long range is occasional 15 mins on a road which allows 100kmh. Would this issue be due to frequent short distance driving and soot not being burnt and building up, or does it seem like something serious?",

Estimated payment would be around $500 at the dealership but it would come with all of their insurance packages and coverages which they listed at 31k without it it would be around 24k, it only has 27k Miles. But I’ve been thinking about switching to a 2021 Acura TLX A-Spec AWD V6 turbo. It has about 45,000 miles on it, listed at 27k but it’s a big step up in terms of performance, luxury, and overall driving experience. estimated payment is still about 500$. Here’s my situation: • I’d be financing either way • I drive daily and take occasional road trips • I like sporty cars but still care about gas mileage • I want to make sure the upgrade is worth it long term in terms of value, feel, and reliability Do you think it’s worth making the switch from the Altima to the TLX? Im open to hearing any suggestions or recommendations!",

I went in for repairs because the check engine light came on recently and the guy who usually fixes my car quoted me about $1,000 to fix the issues which amounted to several codes concerning engine misfire and fuel injector issues. I had told myself that if the bill for these repairs was to exceed $500 that I was just going to get a new car and put the money that I would have spent on the Prius into the new car. So I did just that. I went and got my Prius and I'm still driving around but I went and basically did everything but signed the paper saying that I'm going to buy a 2021 Subaru Crosstrek in outstanding condition from an outstanding dealer close to my area. But now I'm laying in bed thinking that if I fix the Prius's engine problems, get a new battery, get new tires and get a new catalytic converter and pay for comprehensive and collision so that if the cat gets stolen again I can get it reimbursed and I get a cat shield that's actually worth something and all that then it's going to cost about $14,000 less than getting the new Subaru.

Ok but the curb weight is only 31 pounds lighter than the base Volkswagen Golf of the time. 1992 Mclaren F1 = 2513 1992 Volkswagen Golf (mk3) = 2544lb The McLaren fits 1 person comfortably and 2 more but tight, it also has no trunk for storage The golf fits 4 people comfortably (5 in a pinch) and has a rear storage area So my question is: 1.

All went smoothly and I remember drooling over the skyline when it was all polished and ready. Over the next few weeks we misplaced a horse shoe dolly, - chunk of heavy iron we use to beat against when straightening a panel. About 4 months later, the car was back to have a sideskirt repaired. Owner mentioned that he was having a issue with the car, hadn't drove it and rubbing the skirt at a petrol station was almost enough to make him sell it! Asked what the issue was and he explained that not always but sometimes when he goes onto the brakes, there is a grinding/scraping noise followed by a thud coming from the P/S and that what really bothered him was that when it wouldn't do on the brakes, it would on take-off, hitting bumps and the car rattled loudly enough pedestrians could hear it. He had it with 3 different garages to no avail but it hadn't done it in awhile so he was waiting to see. We went for a rip to figure it out - got into 3rd gear after lighting it up and sure enough, there's some of the most unusual noise I've ever heard coming from a car! But we could tell it was coming from the wheelarch or door areas??? We never lost tools for more than a few days...... that missing dolly popped straight into our heads. Bossman had left the dolly inside the door we repaired months before, the noise was it sliding up and down along the door until it hit either the front or rear of the frame. Never let him live it down - always reminded him to put his dolly's away after play-time, customer was relieved but also quite pissed about it so we fixed the skirt for free 😆",

    "selftext": "So something that's been on my mind lately has been a situation that happened when I was still getting my driving lessons. I don't know much about cars, but I remember waiting on traffic lights and was about to turn left. And as I accelerated and started to turn, what would happen is that I would need to change to the 2nd gear as well to keep the acceleration going. But because I'm turning what I would do let go of the gas for a bit is hold the clutch as I turned and as I was done with the turn I would switch to 2nd gear and let go of clutch and keep accelerating. The instructor right on that moment said not to press the clutch in that situation, but was extremely impressed that I did it without the car jerking. My assumption was that there was a chance that the car would halt or possibly I could have broken the gears or something. Much like what often happens to people in traffic lights when they're about to start moving. Or is it just that holding the clutch while letting the car move through momentum is bad?",

        "body": "So what I think is happening... The instructor is saying don't shift during a turn for a few reasons, but the ones that jump out at me are in order: 1. Some people have trouble turning their car around a corner in an automatic. Most people can't accelerate into a turn, mid turn shift, keep the turn coming on their chosen line, and continue to accelerate after the shift has happened. Think lowest common denominator teaching and that's what instructors are usually at. 2. If you need to slow down for whatever reason, or delay your shift, the rev matching isn't as clean or smooth, so the car does tend to jerk causing wear on the car in various places. 3. When you are turning, accelerating, or braking, your tire contact patch is bigger on the various tires. When accelerating, the drive tires have a larger contact patch vs the free coasting tires (think front wheel drive vs all wheel drive), and have more traction. Each tire only has so much traction. In my head, I think of each tire only having 100 marbles worth of traction. When you accelerate at a moderate pace, you use 15 or 20 marbles of traction for accelerating which leaves 80 marbles for other stuff like turning. When you're braking, you might need 30-50 marbles of traction to stop the car, leaving up to 50 marbles for turning or preventing you from sliding off the road. When you're accelerating and turning, you actually lose the marbles of traction and moving them to turning and when you need to accelerate again while you are turning, you might run out of marbles if you accelerate or turn too fast. This is an over simplified explanation, and you can gain or lose marbles based on acceleration, deceleration, turn rate, weight of the vehicle, environmental factors, suspension, and a whole list of other factors. 4. People are dumb sometimes and do wonky stuff when the left side of their body needs to do something different from the right side in a new environment. Don't over complicate it, but keep learning new stuff.",

I'm not familiar with engines yet so I'm not completely sure what specific concerns to look out for. Anyways I hit some black ice and slid it into a tree on some pretty rural country roads without phone for a tow, so I decided to send it the 12 or so miles home. I didn't notice the coolant reservoir cracked on impact so it started overheating after a few miles and eventually went into limp mode for the last stretch. In the middle of my panic I was focused on not getting stranded, so I regrettably did not stop to let it cool down. It is a 2003 chevy tahoe with the little 4.8 vortec. I was able to start it after I got home and it ran good enough to move it out of the driveway. I'm not too concerned about the body damage, the frame is still solid and straight, I'm just too inexperienced with engines yet so if anybody would have some pointers or knowledge on it Id appreciate it.",

    "selftext": "I recently got into an accident with my car (2012 Nissan pathfinder) and the damage appears to be extensive but purely cosmetic (bern driving it since). I filed a claim with my insurance and an adjuster is scheduled to come look at it tomorrow. I just replaced the brakes and suspension on this car and I planned on driving it into the ground (it has 170k miles on it but drives great). I am afraid they will declare my car a total loss as it will likely cost more to fix then the car is worth. This puts me in a bind because I still owe a decent amount of money on if and I believe it's also more then what the car is worth. I would be ok fixing it myself but I read that I'd get a salvage title and I wouldn't be able to drive it anyway. What do I do? Should I cancel the claim and tell the adjuster not to come? Should I just take the loss and not have a car for however long it takes me to get another one?",

I believe the transmission is in limp mode or something. I've taken it to probably 30 different mechanics & they all say it's fine. I tell them it only happens in drive at idle during duty cycle it doesn't hold the duty cycle like it once did. Cold start duty cycle normally the RPM would rev up to 2000 RPM then once equalized the RPM would slowing decrease to around 900 RPM. It feels as though there is a restriction but nobody can help me diagnose it. I went to a transmission shop they said my transmission was good no problems.I went to a very good transmission shop called trans-action owned by Jeff, who has been rebuilding transmissions over 30 years. I understand speed sensor could cause this problem possibly & have no clue about this car. It's been a problem for 3 years. The brake assist feels funny like it's lacking in power, I purchased a vacuum HG kit & found no vacuum leakage anywhere. I stopped driving it because I have another car, but would really like it fixed. I got codes for the charcoal canister & replaced that new with solenoid & still it's throwing the P0419, P0420, p0421. Sometimes it accelerates smooth & sometimes it feels like there is a blockage. I had my CAT inspected it was not clogged. I replaced the oxygen sensor anyway & it's still Being a turd.

First, I am buying a friend of mines 2012 Nissan Altima that has around 180,000 miles. She is wanting to sell to me for $5,000. Here are a few details about the car: Last August the radiator was replaced for a new one, Apple CarPlay has been installed, and last week the transmission was serviced. To mine and her knowledge, the car has no other problems. Her dad is also a mechanic, so he has made sure the car has been properly taken care of the duration of them owning it. My main question is do yall think that this car will be able to last me the next three years? I am hoping to use it for the remainder of college, and then I will have enough saved to be able to have a car loan. Also, is there anything I should be weary about since it is a relatively older car? Any issues with Nissan in particular? Additionally, is $5,000 a fair price for the car given the mileage? Thanks in advance for your help.",

I could have sworn he said it was a Cadillac, but there’s wood and I don’t know, I don’t know why he bought it, but he never got ‘round to restoring it and he’s letting go of it finally. Is there any value to this, like can I outright just hand it over to someone who has the desire? Someone told me there someone out there that could use things like this for templates, but heck if I know. It’s history, but it’s history. All I see is a junk pile.

First of all every once in awhile when I would give it some gas to pass a slower car it would hesitate a few times like it was running out of gas then level out. Last week I drove it across town heard like a knocking noise but it was faint and didn't last long. I got to my destination, was there forty-five minutes came out started it drove about two miles and it started making that pounding noise again then started cutting out again It kept doing it for about a half mile then when I pulled up to a stop light it died. I tried starting it several times and it acted like it wanted to start but didn't. I got a ride home and tried again and it started but not long but it sounded like crap noises I hadn't heard before and was missing and wanting to die. I replaced the purge valve Canister someone told me to replace it didn't make one difference. Please someone help I'm not a mechanic I'm in S. S.

You can try poking a compressed air nozzle in one of the bulb access holes, but then you also run the risk of introducing more dirt. I'd just live with it, it won't cause any harm and probably won't get any worse (as long as all the covers are properly in place on the back of the headlamp)",

The current title is in his name. However, I have been the person driving the truck for the last 10 years. I will be moving to Montana in two weeks, and my truck will be going with me. Soon after I move, I plan to upgrade to a new vehicle that handles winter conditions better. My question is this: will I need to transfer the title to my name before I can trade in the truck at a dealership? Or can my dad just sign the title, and I can trade in the truck on his behalf? I know that if I do transfer it to my name first, I will have to pay the state several hundred dollars in title transfer in registration fees, which I would like to avoid if possible. Sorry if this is the wrong sub to ask this question. If there’s a different sub where this can be better answered, please let me know!",

Here's the [Amazon link](https://a.co/d/gE929gI) for it. The one in your picture does look a little different in shape and length than the one my car had, which is the same thing I ordered, could be the picture angle, but it doesn't hurt to try to see if it fits. Sadly it's kind of normal for these rubber hoses to crack and break as they're old and the rubber has degraded and hardened a lot. Also is that an aftermarket intake? Like a cold air or short ram intake? It doesn't look like the stock airbox for the 2AZ. If it is you may need a different hose than what is stock on the car.",

Any competent mechanic can put it on a lift and spin the wheel while listening to the bearings while using a stethoscope and determine if it needs to be replaced. If that's not it, they (or you) could also get a \"chassis\" ear and try to pinpoint the location of the noise. It's just some Bluetooth microphones you place in various spots and then listen while changing between them to find which is loudest. Last thought and based on noise I kinda doubt it but, could be wind noise if its only when moving. I doubt its it as the pitch or volume should vary based on speed. Also, you would have more than likely noticed it possibly after running over some debris or hitting something. If you do think it's wind you can use some painter's tape in various locations on the trim to try to pinpoint the location. Lastly and its a joke but install a better radio lol.",

    "selftext": "We were getting ready to sell my 2005 Ford Escape 3.0L V6 (176k miles) and wanted to fix it up as much as feasible before we put it up for sale. We went to AutoZone to check what the check engine light was for, and it came to be that cylinder 4 had a misfire (P0304). We also took it to AutoZone because when idling at like a stop light, my car would kinda shake a little bit more than normal. I don’t know much about cars so I took the advice that I saw online the most, which is to replace all spark plugs and ignition coils. The parts arrived and I took it to a mechanic that my grandpa recommended and told him about our issue. We told him that the car was shaking when idling but forgot to mention the cylinder misfire code. The next day, we went to pick up the car and he told us that the cylinder misfire was still there, even after all the parts had been replaced. He said that we would most likely have to replace the whole engine to see what the issue is. He also said that the car was probably worth $1k and that he would buy it off of us. We said that we wanted to see how it felt before we made a decision and then left. I drove home and let my car idle for a bit. It started doing this “shooting” noise every once in a little bit. That is the video that is attached. This is something that the mechanic mentioned the car was doing. What should I do? Should I try to sell it on FB marketplace for a little more than $1k? Should I send it to get fixed? Could it be fixed some other way, other than replacing the whole engine?",

    "selftext": "So my car has been stalling from time to time especially during rainy weather, after me being super annoying to my friend who’s a mechanic I’ve discovered it’s an electric problem and then I identified this exposed wire on my car. Whether or not that’s the cause of my problem I know it’s definitely not supposed to look like that and needs to be addressed. I considered since majority of the exposed wires’ hairs seem to be intact except for 1 or 2, if I were to wrap them in electrical tape and they be ok? Do I need to repair them with a crimp/ heat shrink tubing? If I do need to repair the wire with the crimp, how dangerous is that to do myself? Am I one step away from blowing up my car or is it a pretty straight forward task? I’m pretty technically inclined and I took automotive in high school, I’m just super weird about electrical stuff and starting a fire. My mechanic friend told me I can go ahead and try and possibly be unsuccessful but as long as I “don’t touch metal to other metal” I should be ok safety wise. So ultimately my question is, would the electrical tape pretty much fix it or should I repair it, and if I repair it is it worth paying a pro over $200 to do or is it pretty straight forward to do myself? (I know the wiring looks awful on my car, the “mechanic” who sold me the car clearly doesn’t know what he’s doing with wiring I fear",

As for if you should pay a mechanic to do it, it depends on what wires you are replacing if any. If it’s a short wire and you know exactly where it goes by all means do it yourself.

Safety wise for you to repair? Very safe, 12 volts can’t really shock you, maybe a little tickle if you’re soaking wet head to toe and licking the battery posts worst case scenario. The way I’d go about this one is (very) carefully cut the loom and tape on the harness a couple inches either side and pull the damaged wires up, snip them in the middle, one at a time and cut back until i hit clean wire, use heat shrink butt connectors and crimp them together. You may have to add a length of wire if you don’t hit clean copper right away, just make sure it’s the same gauge as the rest of the wire, or at least a size or two bigger if necessary. Then once you’re all done neatly tape it up and stick any Christmas tree fasteners back in you might have had to remove. If you have any sort of handiness you should be able to handle this one if you do them one at a time and don’t mix up wires. Good luck!",

You are gonna need tools and basic mechanical skills, there are plenty of videos to watch and learn as well. Airbags can be replaced, they are not cheap but you can find them at junkyards. You could resell it with a salvage title or just keep it as an extra vehicle to bang around in, haul the dog to the park in it, spill your 32 ounce drink, something you won't have to worry about every little scratch or ding. You could also find one with a bad motor or trans that isn't crashed and use your good parts to make another vehicle. Someone else is going to buy it at auction and do the same thing, only they will likely swap the vin and sell it to some poor sucker like it's never been in a crash.",

    "selftext": "i have a 2015 buick encore and was driving on the highway the other day when it completely just shut off. I put gas in it the day before that so i know that is not the issue. the battery shut off and the wheels locked and i was hardly able to pull over and stop. the mechanic (after having it for 5 days) is telling me that its simply because i ran out of gas and my tank is empty. once again, i quite literally just filled up the day before and know for a fact that i had at least half a tank left. he’s giving me back my car now but i don’t feel safe in it now - especially since he’s not repairing a problem that i strongly believe is there. does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions on this? thanks",

Usually, when those happen, you will stall out but you'll still have access to the dash, radio, lights and other electrical items. However, if the car shutoffs suddenly and you lose all electrical power (no lights, dash or radio) that usually indicates an electrical issue. I would go through and clean of the battery terminals and reinstall nice and secure the go get my battery and alternator tested.

Personally I like to run tires harder and with less rear bias, but that’s trying to get my street car to match my preferred racing setup. I like very neutral handling, even a touch of oversteer on the track, and for good reason street car manufacturers want to have everybody set up with so much understeer it’s impossible to stop pushing and get tailhappy. They have to set up for the average, or least common denominator, but I’m not either of those. I also wouldn’t recommend my setup for anyone else. For you I’d suggest you try 2.3 all around, go find an empty parking lot or a real skid pad, and work it out to see how you like it. Always make sure you’re on a good clean surface, well clear of potential obstacles. Start slow and gradually work up to more intense accelerations (mostly sideways). You’ll be changing the front-rear bias so do things like hard braking in the middle of hard cornering, paying attention to how it feels and if the tail gets loose from weight transfer. Play with things like slowly increasing braking during a long arc, or sudden panic braking in the middle of a faster turn. Try to see how it feels around the edges of the envelope, without abruptly puncturing the envelope. After you do that with 2.3 on all corners of the car set the fronts to 2.1 and the rears to 3.2 and do it again. See what the differences are, and which you prefer. Go with that.",

On the dot every two months it breaks down and is costing me a fortune to repair - it’s unsustainable. I’m looking at upgrading to a small SUV/SUV as I travel for work and need more space. Here are the cars im thinking about. They’re all secondhand/have had previous owners. - Renault Captur Full Hybrid, Automatic with a 2023-2025 plate. - Cupra Formentor, Automatic and a 2022-2024 plate. - Kia Sportage, Automatic and a 2023-2025 plate. - Peugeot 2008 Automatic 2023-2025 plate. (Have seen people say this is not reliable) The formentor would be a LOT of fun and i saw it in person yesterday! It’s got my interest along with the Captur Hybrid, but i know the formentor is faster. I’d be looking to put down £5500 and keep some for my insurance. I don’t know a huge amount about cars and are very torn between these. I have a good salary and need something that is known to be reliable. I understand there are general up keeping expenses for cars, but what I’ve been paying has been extortionate. Can everyone give me their thoughts or some advice? Thanks",

    "selftext": "So I'm not sure if this would be the right group to post this in, but I'm gonna try. I bought a 2012 Nissan Murano SL off of Marketplace a few days ago. I had my father in law go with me because I didn't know the whole process and wanted to make sure I didn't get scammed. He's bought 4 cars off of Marketplace in the past 2 years so I thought I was good. Wrong. The car ended up being a salvage vehicle bought from an auction. I test drove it and everything seemed fine other than a cracked bumper and one light out in the back which I was fine with fixing. I called insurance company to find out what made it salvage and they said rear bumper, rear lamps and lift gate. I've priced those parts out and I can afford it. My question is, if I fix the repairs that the insurance company listed, will I be able to get the title rebuilt without the person who sold it to me? They are gone and no longer responding to me because they lied about the title being clear. Also, the title is from the Copart auction in GA, but I'll be doing all of this in MS. Not sure if that matters or if it's gonna be some crazy process.",

I took it to get tags and the lady pulled the sticker right off and my heart sank. She said I'd have to get in contact with who sold it to me for receipts, but that person didn't fix anything and I can't get a hold of them anyways. They lied and said it was clear when really she had bought it salvage at the auction a few weeks earlier.

We live in a city and she parks her car on the street. She's considering getting a dash can that can record 24/7 but she's worried about it needing to get wired into the car. Anyone have suggestions on dash cams that can record without being hard wired in or any other surveillance tips?",

Anything you plug into your 12v socket will probably power off when you stop the car because the 12v socket is only powered when the car is running. If the goal is to record while the car isn't running you'll need a \"wired in\" solution. Edit: is this happening while she is at home? Perhaps a camera on the house recording her parking spot would be better? Most aftermarket dash cams record out the front windshield and rear windows.

I'm assuming they didn't know. At one point I was directly behind them. Even without brake lights I still could see when they slowed down and/or came to a stop and did so myself, keeping a safe distance. However, at another time another car was behind them and kept getting right up on them. And kept having to hit their brakes. I've encountered other cars without brake lights before and always watched the car itself, even before realizing it had none, and could tell when it was slowing down or stopping. So why is it so many other people can't see that without relying on seeing the brakes light up?",

        "body": "You have a mild vacuum leak, likely in the vacuum line supplying the brake booster. The engine is constantly pulling air through several restrictions, as well as the head pressure and inertia of the air inside the plenum and manifold. The brakes use below ambient pressure from inside the intake manifold to act on a diaphragm and give you extra mechanical power to squeeze the master cylinder. This produces pressure on the order of 5psi inside the intake, giving approximately 10psi differential applied across a 6-10\" diaphragm at the brake booster. It's doing this at all rpm, but you notice it at idle because idle air control, closed throttle plate, low rpm is the lowest torque output running condition of the engine. The engine runs leaner momentarily because the amount of air the engine ingests is more than the metered air passing over the mass airflow sensor. The fuelling program is delivering fuel for perhaps 1cf/s of air and the leak allows the engine to eat 1.01cf/s. This means reduced power, and thus a lower idle. The proper way to fix this is to put a smoke tester in the intake and find the leak. Then, replace the line in question. There will be several vacuum lines, likely for the EGR valve, fuel pressure regulator, brake booster, crankcase vent, perhaps transmission kickdown, and maybe the blend door actuator. Or, since it's a 16 year old Toyota, say fuck it and run it.",

Based on where the drip is, I'm going to rule out the filter and filler cap since those are on the other side of that engine. Also, the valve covers are on the sides of this engine and may be too far away from where the leak is, but many vehicles do develop leaks from the gaskets over time and mileage. If it is coming from a valve cover, oil might find its way to that area. One problematic area is the rear main seal, and that is right where you are pointing out, providing I'm looking at this from the right angle. The PVC baffle plate is in this area as well. Spark plug tube seals would be another area to take a look at. Also, if parked for several hours, how much of a pool, if any, is on the ground below the leak? Additionally, check the dip stick when the engine is cold, prior to driving again, to see if the level is between the fill lines. How well is the engine running? Is there an indicator near your gauges that shows an illuminated icon of an oil can or something similar? That would indicate a problem with oil pressure. I'm not as familiar with boxer engines as I am with inlines and Vs. There could be areas I'm overlooking. Hopefully, someone with more knowledge about horizontal engines will chime in if I'm wrong or missing something.",

Then checked 3 hours later and nothing on the cardboard and it hadn’t quite formed another drop on the car (although it was starting to form). I cannot trace where the leak is coming from because everything appears dry above this on all sides (this is after cleaning the area real well and then checking 3 hours later when the drop was starting to form again). I think it’s coming right from this spot. Although isn’t this the transmission? According to a chart I saw online, it looks like Crosstrek transmission fluid should be green. I certainly will not rule out that I’m just missing something and will be getting someone to take a look next week. The car is running completely fine and no oil pressure light. Oil level cold is right at the max fill dot. Car is 1,400 miles since last oil change. Not sure if seeing the color on the paper towel is helpful but in case it is, this is what just came off where the drop is. https://preview.redd.it/1gtkwfqogkye1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b432b12e8120a73e2b689280b38d975ee0ad98ec",

I've read both success stories but also folks saying absolutely cannot seal from the outside. If there's any chance of it working though (and not ruining other things in the process), it seems it'd certainly be worth the price difference",

        "body": "Damn! Is that $2k just to replace the seal/gasket? I posted another reply and immediately deleted it because you have a sealed transmission, and a stop-leak additive would be of no use. As for trying to seal it from the outside, you could try something like JB Weld (cold weld epoxy). A couple of screw type c-shaped clamps can be used to possibly tighten that area a little more to prevent leaking while attempting the repair. It looks like there's enough of an edge for the clamps to grab ahold of. This may buy you some time, but it is only meant to be a temporary solution. Full details are listed below. A cold-weld epoxy, like JB Weld, can be used to seal a minor transmission leak from the outside at the seam, but it's crucial to ensure proper preparation and application. The key is to thoroughly clean and degrease the area before applying the epoxy to ensure a strong and lasting bond. Make sure the type used is for metal applications. Instructions: Clean the area: Thoroughly remove all oil, grease, and dirt from the leaking area. Use a solvent like acetone or brake cleaner to degrease the surface. Scuff the surface: Slightly roughen the area around the crack with sandpaper to improve adhesion. Apply the epoxy: Mix the epoxy according to the manufacturer's instructions and apply it to the crack, ensuring it fills any voids. Clamp if necessary: You may need to use a couple of C clamps to tighten down the 2 halves of the housing prior to and during the process to prevent the leaking fluid from mixing with the epoxy as it cures. Temporary Solution: While epoxy can be effective, it's often considered a temporary fix. I hope this helps. It's definitely more cost-effective than a $2,000 transmission repair. However, that will still need to be done at some point. The leak will likely spread over time. Edit: The mechanic who ends up performing the full repair isn't going to enjoy removing the epoxy when the time comes.",

Many?most cars nowadays have a rear disc brake, you can see and even touch the disc (rotor) thru holes in your rim, BUT, the hand brake may be a smallish drum behind the rotor which you can't see, so removing the wheel becomes necessary and even problematic to remove the rear rotor+drum by a mechanic.",

I wasn't earning a lot of money at the time think it was $77 a fortnight in the RAAF Australian Airforce. Needed a car to get around was stationed at the time in a country town. There was a bus into town but made things very inconvenient. Was posted to my home city but was a fair 45 to 60 min drive from home each day there and back. I mainly just did that on weekends. Stayed on bade during the week. We had to pay for our meals as well but they were cheap but plentiful. They feed us well that's one positive about the armed services. It was a good job and life. Unfortunately, I had to get out after 2 1/2 years as my mother was sick looking at possible open heart surgery. I didn't want to be so far away from her I was posted 6 hours away by car up north of home. Back then only had a part expressly the rest was 2 lane country roads. Quite dangerous at times. Plenty of potholes. This was back in the early 70s. Open heart surgery was very dangerous, they were looking at replacing 2 heart valves but she was considered not a good candidate. She also had other medical issues as well. My father was a real piece of shit, treated her badly. Didn't hit her just verbalised her and cheated on her a lot. I eventually convinced her to leave him and I rented a couple of different places. She then got a government housing assistance place for the 2 of us. She only had that for about 3 years. My father died I got married not long after and because he died my brother had nowhere to live. So I gave up my place with my mother and rented one with my soon-to-be wife. My mother ended up in a nursing home following a second stroke. Had terrible care. I moved her to another facility run by Nuns she was dead within 2 weeks. Didn't even call me to say she was in a bad way. Just called after she went. I think they held off her medications and that's why she died. Her chart wasn't near her bed and they wouldn't let me look at it. I should have taken leave without pay and cared for her myself, I'm a qualified nurse which is why I was and have been so angry about it since 1981. But hindsight is great, isn't it? My brother sold everything he could from her flat and then left. I had no idea he did until I went over there with my wife. Sadly I couldn't move in as I wasn't on the records of living there at the time. Anyway, we preferred where we were living suited us well. Although I had a long drive to work and back each day.",

Obviously I have a while to go, and usually that wouldn't be an issue for me. However, I just had a baby last year and I'm due with another this December. Things get expensive, and I want to try my best to lower any costs I have so I can at least stay home on some days with the kids. Anyway, my question is this: Is it smarter to continue to pay my monthly payments on this car, or to get a used, cheaper car that I can pay off faster and with less of a payment? I didn't even know how to get rid of a car with a loan. It's in good condition, never been in an accident. Anyway, that's probably too much info. But does anyone have any advice or personal insight?

        "body": "Hey, first off congrats on the growing family! You’re not alone in this kind of situation (I'm a father of 2) Getting rid of a car with a loan is very doable, but there are a few moving pieces. The key thing is whether the car is worth more than what you owe (i.e., you have positive equity). Check the car’s current value using sites like Kelley Blue Book and compare it to your payoff amount. If it's worth more than $19K, you can sell it, pay off the loan, or trade it in and put the leftover cash toward a cheaper car or just pocket the savings. If it’s worth less, you'd have to come up with the difference to pay off the loan when selling. Never trade in a car with negative equity unless you can pay the difference up front. Rolling negative equity will increase your interest rate on your new loan and often times you'll end up paying more in the long run. Once you know where you stand, if you can get into a solid, reliable used car with lower monthly costs, it might relieve some financial pressure. But you also should factor in costs like gas, and maintenance. Sometimes a newer car with a warranty can be cheaper overall than an older car with surprise repairs.",

I would definitely stay away from the fusion and altima, the altima has a time bomb for a transmission and the fusion isn’t necessarily reliable either.

    "selftext": "I beesech you automotive angels. You hydraulic heros. Diesel dogooders. Hoping someone can just assure me my car isn't on the verge of exploding bc I'm seriously losing sleep on it. I've noticed for a few weeks now when I start up my car it's a cloud of whiteish/bluish smoke that disappates and I don't notice it during actual driving, sometimes it's a little and thin and I don't see until I reverse into it, sometimes it's a more pronounced cloud that wafts slowly and mocks me as it meanders away. I wasn't too concerned about it at first bc it had been a little chillier in the morning as I was leaving for work...but its warming up and the smoke remains. Car seems to run as usual, I don't see any signs of overheating, no sweet or burning smells, no check engine light, sometimes it does idle low and maybe starts to stutter a bit if it's been running a while (like extended stop and go traffic) but that's pretty rare. My main worry is that the coolant system has given me grief in the past and always seems to be low...so I'm fairly certain it's leaking into the engine. From everything I've been able to research its horrible news and might as well pack it in, and I basically hold my breath my entire commute now and have avoided driving it at all costs...I even walked to the store! And I hate walking to my kitchen. On my 3rd night in a row of being unable to sleep I went out,at midnight,in my pjs and with my phone flashlight and tried to see for myself if it looked like coolant and oil were mixing(I know the pics are not great..I had to smudge some oil on my finger bc it was hard to balance the phone and hold the dipstick) and a real actual diagnostic is needed...which I will get but at the moment things are so tight it's almost hard to breathe, which is obviously when disaster likes to strike. But if someone could just tell me how fast my car is becoming a ticking time bomb maybe I could catch some zzz's bc it's mostly the unknown and all the equally horrible possibilities that branch off it that is keeping my blood pressure sky high. thank you all so much for any time you spend on me. I'd be so grateful for even bad news at this point.",

        "body": "Pull off the top plastic runner right above the top of the dent and see if there is a hole/access window to insert PDR tools through to pop the dent out from the inside. If there is great, if not you have a choice to make. Pull the bed off to see if you can access it from the front that is against the cab currently, or drill a hole up top to put tools in to pop out the dent. If you drill it make sure to primer/paint it too to prevent rust. Another option is to use stick on pdr dent pullers but you may need to pop it from the inside first due to the size, plus to get all the small wrinkles out you'll need to use pdr tools from the inside anyways so if you can't find an access window you might as well make your own. By the time you're done buying all the tools and supplies you'd need you might end up paying just as much as you would taking it to a pdr tech to have it done for you. If you want to do it yourself though go watch some videos on YouTube on dent pulling and pdr. While I know pdr is paintless dent removal and preserving paint isn't exactly a concern here, it's still great educational material on how to properly do body work. As far as paint work afterwards that's something you'll have to do some research on. You could always use a 2k primer paint can, go to an automotive paint shop and have them load a spray can with OEM matched paint, and then use some 2k clear over top, but do some research on prep and finishing work before you start anything. Every layer has to be sanded/wet sanded/prepped in some way for it to come out right so do your homework.",

It might happen once every 3 weeks or few months it's pretty random and when it trips the code my engine starts acting very slow and sluggish and when going from 2nd to 1st gear (auto btw) it lurches forward. This happens EVERY time that it goes from 2nd to 1st but ONLY when the CEL is on. I cleared the code and immediately the lurching and slow acceleration goes away. I read that there is a TSB from Subaru that might affect my car, stating my ECM can cause a false P0300 DTC due to the wrong amounts of fuel and air mixture on startup. I tried to confirm this with the dealership but they said TSB's for ECM don't show up and to bring it in and they can diagnose it. I just got it diagnosed at another shop and they didn't know what was wrong with it and said maybe it was carbon buildup or maybe my spark plugs needed changing but again they were unsure. I wasn't about to pay them 1300 for a \"maybe\". I'm just curious if it is an ECM problem, am I causing damage to my car by clearing the code when it comes back so I dont deal with the jerky acceleration/deceleration?",

I’m worried that with 5% all around it will be way to dark for night driving so that makes me lean towards doing 15% on the drivers and passenger windows but if I do that I need to go darker on the windshield to compensate for the lighter window tint on the front windows so it still looks dark looking in from outside but I have more visibility from inside. I’m just worried that the 35% windshield will be too dark for night driving but when I had 55% on front windshield on my last car you couldn’t even tell there was tint on it from inside the car looking out so maybe the 35 front windshield will be no big deal? Or maybe the 5% all around won’t be as bad as I’m thinking? My tint shop doesn’t offer 10% in ceramic and I’m not going anywhere else so that leaves me with those options. Please help!!!",

But I am trying to find a way to skip songs via my steering wheel, rather than having to tap on the CarPlay screen. I believe I have the bass model car so there are no buttons behind the steering wheel that would allow me to control my media/music. I was wondering if there was something I can buy and attach to my steering wheel that would allow me to skip songs and such. If anyone has any ideas or tips, it would be super super helpful!!!

Flies perfectly straight and aerodynamically in the air. I'd be very very dead otherwise. I've taken her off jumps and flown that car far enough to make Evil Knievel look like a pansy and the car didn't bat an eye. Face down ass up with no weight and all the body roll there could ever be. Feels like a boat and a racecar at the exact same time. Probably the most comfortable place I've ever sat in my entire life was the driver seat of that shit box. Used to get off work and raise hell on the back roads all night long, taking each curve faster and faster and faster until the understeer ditched me. That car pulled me out of plenty of ditches that would have gotten me stuck for good in any other car. Deep in cornfields with 8 foot embankments were no problem. If I can get an inch of momentum I'm out. I floored it once on the highway going downhill to see what my top speed was. 107 mph. 107 in a straight line on new highway was a million times more scary than flying 100 yards through the air or sliding around a curve at 45mph. Just trying to go 65mph was pushing the car to its limit. Any faster than that and it feels like the car is going to explode. If I accidentally glance away from the speedometer in an xc70 I'll be going 90mph without even realizing it. In that car, 90 feels like 60mph. In the escort, 90 feels like 180mph. If you turn off highways and toll roads and drive for the pure joy of getting lost, exploring, and enjoying every little bit of the journey with no real concern for the destination, there is not a more comfortable car. It's bigger on the inside and the lack of weight will save you from a lot of mistakes that would kill you in a modern heavy car. If you actually want to get somewhere at some distance quickly and actually drive on highways without being a legitimate hazard, that's a really bad car for it.",

Only cars that profit from petrol are small light cars and motorcycles, lawnmowers, outboard boat engines etc. I'd say diesel has quite a lot versatility too. Yes, petrol engines can run on liquid gas, but diesel engines (not modern standardised engines) can be designed to run on almost any oil, including used frying oil. So it's a win on reliability, versatility, economy, longevity, and more. A loss on sound and likely polution.

For the vast majority of people, the performance of a modern TDI is going to be very similar to that of a modern Petrol engine, for day to day activities. If you want to go to a track, that's a completely different story, but most people do not do that. Sounds as in how good it sounds or how loud is it? If it's the \"how good it sounds\", again, most people don't care about that, if it's the loudness, they aren't terribly loud once you're inside driving, and especially after a certain speed where tires and wind are going to be a lot louder than the engine itself. Reliability, if you take care of a Diesel properly they will easily last 500k km and also go 1M+ km. The biggest downside of a Diesel is that it hates stop-and-go traffic and it hates to be driven for frequent short intervals. The biggest upside on the other hand, is that they absolutely shine as a long-range-cruiser, the fuel economy they provide is really good. I drive a TDI and with my current situation, I wouldn't switch it with a petrol because it doesn't make financially sense for me as a daily driver, even if the petrol is probably going a lot more fun, when I go to a race track.",

Reliability is also generally better because diesel engines are made entirely out of iron and more durable overall so they last much longer. More recent engines encounter problems from the nearly endless list of filters and valves meant to make them cleaner, which is another problem they have, they're dirty and also smell like shit. Overall diesel engines are second to none if you're actually using them for what they're good at.",

        "body": "I'm not sure you've got your facts straight. Diesels aren't less reliable then gasoline engines. In most cases the opposite is true. They have a lot fewer moving parts and they operate at very high compression ratios and so they have to be built very sturdily if they're going to run at all. They are very good at doing some things (generating torque) and not great at doing other things (generating horsepower). This is why you'll never see a sportbike with a diesel, but the bigger the truck the more likely that it is a diesel. I'm not qualified to give a great explanation between the two but a vast oversimplification is torque is great for getting something really heavy moving from a standstill and horsepower is great for going really really fast. If you're measuring power by the spoonful, torque is kind of like the size of the spoon and horsepower is sort of like how many spoonfuls per minute are getting delivered. You just can't spin a diesel very fast, so you'll never make that much HP. Each type has its own advantages. If you want to take a deeper dive, you should look into the relative advantages and disadvantages of each cylinder configuration. Not just the number of cylinders , but also the arrangement. A V-4 is a very different beast than an inline 4. A general rule: if the total displacement stays the same, engines with more cylinders will generate more horsepower and fewer cylinders will generate more torque. No one engine is the best or all the engines would use that type of fuel, have that cylinder arrangement and you just make it in a bunch of different sizes. There's different types of performance. The engine has to fit, some are more expensive to manufacture, some are easier to cool, some of them are less likely to break, some of them don't scale up in size very well and some of them don't scale down in size very well.",

If you have ever had that connector off prior to your problems, you need to check the ECU pin field for a bent or damaged pin. So many times I have found someone damaging pins when pulling the ECU to replace or tune it. But odds are higher that the injector itself or its trigger wiring is bad.

But I feel like I just got smacked upside the head. 4th and 5th(Overdrive) don't seem to exist. I can't feel any gates, double clutching doesn't work, a buddy of mine even suggested trying to gently engage at a standstill to see if it would open anything even if it stalled. Nothing. Now am I just stupid? Did he miss something in inspection? Or did I just get fleeced? Little side note, the car does what I need it to do, and I'm not complaining because I'm upset with the performance, I just feel like this should have been easy to spot and higher up the disclosure priorities.",

My 23 WRX allows for 87 octane, but runs like shit on it (no knock, but a 14% hit to fuel efficiency and the power difference is noticeable). It's tuned for 91. Older cars will absolutely knock if the octane rating is too low, and will eventually destroy the engine. Higher octane fuel takes more heat to ignite than lower octane fuel. If your vehicle is rated for 91, and you run 87, eventually you will get hotspots in the piston hot enough to set the fuel off before the spark. This predetonation of the fuel (which sounds like knocking or pinging) is what can damage your engine. Modern cars can detect knock and compensate by altering the timing to prevent damage, which is why some newer models allow for lower octane than the rated. Cost wise, if it calls for 91, you're not going to save much running 87, even if you don't damage the engine. That 14% loss of fuel efficiency means that the 87 would need to be ~$0.50 cheaper to break even, and that's not counting the extra time spent filling up, as you will need to put more fuel in per mile anyway (more trips to the pump).",

If you run a lower octane fuel (say mid grade, and it calls for premium), you can experience pre-detonation, (sounds like a pinging) which will burn up the valves, and eventually the engine. Go with the 93, you'll get better performance as well",

If the regulator is damaged or the window is off it's track, then you'll likely need to disassemble the door card and repair the regulator. As someone mentioned, if pulling the window by hand, helping it along, or shifting it back and forth fixes the problem temporally this would indicate a problem with the regulator/window track/window guides, and not the calibration.

The sound only happens on that setting, if I switch to low intermittent, it goes away. I recently replaced the wiper blades, so I don’t think they’re the issue. Has anyone experienced something similar or know what might be causing it and how to fix it? My car is a Honda Fit 3rd gen hybrid if it helps. Thanks in advance.",

    "selftext": "I lost my only copy of my car keys for good. I spoke to a few locksmiths and I was told that it'd be around 175 for the basic key, but around 600 to get one with a chip. I was wondering if the chip is really necessary for this car? It's older but also I have the XL and the locksmith said it was a luxury model so it'd probably need the chip. But I can't afford 600 dollars. I have someone else who says they can do it but this other guy says that he likely can't without going into the computer and such. I don't want to waste my time or money. Could anyone offer any insight? Thank you.",

After doing more research, it sounds like a bad bearing and a bad wheel hub can present similar problems, is there any ways to tell the difference without taking the tire off?

Wobbling while braking that is telegraphed through the steering wheel is most commonly caused by warped rotors (brake disks). Brake pads typically have a protruding piece of spring steel that, when the pad is thin enough, is designed to drag against the rotor while braking and emit a screech. This is to warn you that the pads need replacing. You should take the car to a mechanic (not a dealer, not a brake repair chain) to be diagnosed. While the brakes are being looked at, have them look over the suspension for other ting that might be dangerously worn, a real possibility in a 37 year old car. Pads and rotors are a fairly easy DIY but need to be done right for safety’s sake.",

It would be an exceptionally bad wheel bearing if it's causing steering vibrations. If the steering wheel shakes constantly, it's probably not a warped rotor. If the steering wheel only shakes while braking, it's almost guaranteed that you have a warped rotor. Squealing is almost certainly a brake issue. You can also be looking at all of the above. Brakes are squealing, possibly overheating the rotor, causing it to warp. The warp rotor cause a runout issues, which take out the bearing. If you have the tools and skills, get the wheels off the ground and have someone shake the tires side to side and top to bottom while you inspect the steering and bearing under the car. If it's vibrating as bad as you are making it out, there should be something obvious.",

The torque box is an important part of the structure of the car. If it is rusted out you want to get it repaired immediately or avoid purchasing the car. The gas tanks of these size and era Fords was mounted in an interesting way. If you open the trunk and peel back the trunk mat on the floor of the trunk you will see that the top of the gas tank is also the floor of the trunk. It is bolted to the rest of the body thru a lip surrounding the tank. The rear springs are leaf springs.

See if you can find the stopping distances and maximum G-force (when cornering/turning) for a 1966 Falcon, and compare them to the same figures for say a 2000 Corolla, a 2010 Corolla, and a 2020 Corolla. If the Falcon has a 6 cylinder engine, maybe look into 0-60 times as well. If you go test drive the Falcon, try an emergency stop in a safe place. After the test drive, drive the same loop and try the same stop in a modern car. Think about the differences in how the cars feel and perform. Cars have changed a lot since the 60's. They have improved performance and efficiency, reduced maintenance requirements, made them easier to drive. There's probably at least a dozen grease points that need to be greased at every 3,000 mile oil change on any 1960's American car, I remember doing these when I worked in a garage during university days. You'll learn to check, set and replace points fairly quickly (or replace them with a retrofit electronic setup). I have driven ordinary used cars from the 60's and 70's. There's an art to getting them to start in cold weather - anything around freezing or lower. The windows fog up like crazy when it rains, unlike in modern cars which generally have AC that dries out the air and rear window defoggers that keep your vision clear so you can see safely. Braking control and stopping distances on 60's American cars was a joke even compared to Japanese compacts from the 70s and 80s, in days of skinny 13\" tires and long before ABS. A 1966 Falcon will probably use 2x or even 3x the fuel of a modern Corolla or Civic.",

    "selftext": "I've got a 2005 Chrysler Crossfire (the make/model doesn't seem relevant, but I'll let the experts be the judge of that) that won't start. I assume my best path forward at this point is to get the battery replaced (more on why I didn't say \"charged\" below) but I figured it'd be worth asking. The symptoms are that nothing happens when I try to start the car. It's got an after-market push-button ignition (installed by the previous owner) with these two switches connected...the first one is the equivalent of turning a key to \"accessories\" and even that produces no effect whatsoever (what *should* be happening is that the button itself lights up along with all the dashboard stuff, etc.). Pushing the button (which should start the car) also has no effect. I'm hesitant to mention the ignition because it's worked fine for years and I worry people will scapegoat it since it's after-market, but here we are. :) The surprising part is that I'd just driven the car a day or two before and it was fine, but I guess every battery's number comes up one day. It's just surprising 'cause I'd expect it to do *something*...dim dashboard lighting, try to turn over but can't summon enough oomph, etc. But it's just *nothing*. OK, so those are the symptoms; now for some details and what I've tried: The battery in question is a World Source One 48MF ([looks like this](https://www.ecstuning.com/b-world-brake-resource-parts/world-source-one-battery-72ah-380a/48mf~wbr/) but of course the OEM has wiped all evidence of its existence from its own site since they no longer sell it) and I have a Noco Genius 10 ([user manual](https://no.co/media/wysiwyg/downloads/User_Guides/Genius/genius10na_user_guide_4.9.2024a.pdf)) battery tender that I generally leave connected all the time, and this was the case here; the car had been in the garage for a few days or so with the tender attached. I don't drive much (it's not unusual for the car to go 2-3 weeks without being started up), and I had to get jumped a couple of times before finally deciding to get a tender; I've probably been using it for a year or so. When I saw the tender sitting in \"standby\" mode while still connected to the battery (according to page 9 of the manual that means the battery's current is so low that the unit can't detect it), I tried activating \"repair mode\" (manual page 5), which from what I understand just sends a bunch of power to the battery for a while to try and recover it. Unfortunately, this didn't work and after the \"repair cycle\" the tender went back to standby mode where it doesn't detect a charge at all. I tried starting the car again just for grins, but sure enough the symptoms hadn't changed (no response to anything). So...should my next step be to replace the battery and then see if that's the only problem (it's certainly *a* problem, but it might not be the *only* problem)? Any other suggestions on what to try for diagnostics purposes? For what it's worth, I just checked The InterPhone™ and it says that batteries generally last three to five years. I don't know exactly how long I've had it but certainly at least three years so it's quite possible that the only \"problem\" here is that a consumable has been exhausted, as expected, and needs to be replaced as per its intended lifespan.",

One fat wire comes from the battery. The other fat wire goes to the starter. The relay exists so the huge current of starter motor does not have to go thru ignition/start key wiring. If found, easy to test things. Either your solenoid is stuck closed (passing 12v to starter ignoring the lack of 12v on smaller wire ....) Or you've got a constant 12v on the smaller wire. If you replace a solenoid, wire brush? clean rust off the metal where the solenoid is bolted to under-hood metal, to avoid grounding issue.

If the engine has been running recently, everything is fine. I can shut it off and start it again within a few hours without any issues. **But when the car sits for longer – either overnight or after an 8-hour workday – I get a hard start.** Here’s what happens: * Back when mornings were colder (\\~5°C), the glow plugs would kick in and the engine started immediately. * Now with daytime temps around 15°C, the glow plugs don’t activate, and that’s when the problem appears. After sitting for \\~8 hours: * It takes **7–10 seconds of cranking** to start. * While cranking, there’s **white smoke** from the exhaust that smells strongly of diesel – unburnt fuel. * When the engine finally fires, it gives off a small puff of **black smoke**, then runs perfectly fine. My first guesses: * It might be **air entering the fuel system** after sitting for hours. * Or maybe the **temperature sensor is giving false readings** – for example, telling the ECU it’s 30°C when it’s actually 15°C, so the ECU doesn’t enrich the mixture properly for a “cold” start. I’ve talked to a few mechanics – most suspect either **injectors and their seals**, or a **failing high-pressure pump**. But here’s the thing: if those components were truly bad, **I’d expect symptoms during driving** too, right? Once the engine is running, it’s completely smooth – no misfires, no hesitation, no smoke. Any ideas what to check next? Much appreciated!",

    "selftext": "Hi, so my 2009 Toyota Corolla was deemed a loss by insurance. I’m super devastated because it was my first (and a perfectly good car!) it seems my only option is to buy a new car so here I am with all of my questions. It most likely will be a used car. Thank you in advance for reading and offering answers/advice. I know next to nothing about cars btw so please speak kindly. 1. What are the most important factors to pay attention to when buying a car used? - I’ve been paying attention to mileage mostly but should there be something else I look at first? My Toyota had about 128K when I bought it and I was close to 138K before the accident. Would it be worth buying another car with that many miles on it? -I’ve also been looking at the year since this was a deciding factor in deeming the car a total loss. It seems that anything over 10 years old is not worth repairs. 2. What car brand are most likely to be reliable? As in, I won’t have to be getting something fixed on it every other week. Like I said, my Toyota Corolla was near perfect (to ME). Aside from a few cosmetic things and the accident, I had to get oil changes and that was it. And even when I didn’t keep up with them, that car still ran great. In case I don’t find another Toyota Corolla, I’d like to go for a make and model where it doesn’t have a lot of maintenance issues. My dad has told me Toyotas and Hondas are pretty reliable cars so those are my first pick but I’m open to whatever can get me where I need to go. I work a lot and rely on a car almost daily. 3. In your honest opinions, is it really too risky to buy a car from someone, (ex: Facebook marketplace). If I could avoid another car payment, that would obviously be ideal but I know that lemons exist and I don’t want to screw myself. However, if I were to go this route, what would be the best way to protect myself?",

The best suggestions I can offer, no matter what brand or what source you find a car you like from, absolutely have a mechanic at a shop of your choice do a pre purchase inspection on the vehicle. They know what to look for and will offer you a detailed inspection and give you an honest evaluation of the vehicle. It should cost less that $100. In fact I believe the last one I had done cost me $30 but it can save you thousands or keep you from buying a nightmare of a car that can look good to you. It will be the greatest favor you can do for yourself. Also most car lots have their own shop, absolutely do not have them do the inspection because they just want to sell cars and their mechanics would most likely tell you what you want to hear instead of the actual truth about the condition of the vehicle.",

I did some digging online and found that there was one aftermarket and one genuine OEM part that I saw. My mechanic said I could bring whichever one I wanted and he’d install it for just $60. That’s a huge difference, but I’m still torn. There’s this aftermarket part called Lemforder that’s made in Germany, and I’m not sure if I should go with that or stick with the original OEM.

I have an OBD2 so I've turned it off a few times and it stays off for like a month at a time. I had the catalytic converters cleaned (I guess that's a new thing) at our local, trusted mechanic. Yet, recently I've been getting the code more frequently. Fuel efficiency has not faltered. RPMs are normal. Mileage per tank is normal. I think it may be a faulty O2 sensor? I take the car 15 mins a day to the local train station for work commute- so no serious driving. I just need it to last me another year or so! I honestly don't know jack about cars, besides how to change a tire, oil, wiper fluid, etc. Any advice will help :p",

Driver safety features are very important to me (i.e. blindspot monitoring, good visibility for the driver, etc)… I think power lift gates are cool, lol… and I’m not sure if any mini SUVs have Parallel Parking Assist, but I LOVED that feature on my Prius! Comfort/style are a plus (but I don’t go off-roading, so that’s not a priority, lol) Budget $30 to $40K, and currently looking at these hybrids: Subaru Forester, Honda CRV, Mazda CX-50, or a Toyota: RAV4, Venza, or Corolla Cross. **Not asking anyone to “do the work” or research for me. :) The context above is just to share what’s important to me; I have an entire working spreadsheet of specs …I’m more just seeking your thoughts, opinions, and personal experiences (the good, the bad, & the ugly!) if you have anecdotes, advice, or your own findings on reliability, etc., to help “steer” me… pun intended!

I have a little money that I got from a personal loan to pay my tax bill this year (government wasting no time to kick me while I’m down) which I planned to stretch to replace the rack and pinions as they are also past due and that’s not the way I want to die. I love my car. I don’t love that in the last week, driving at speeds under 30 mph, my car sounds like, as the title says, a chainsaw, with a little rattle dazzle for good measure. What money I have I want to use to make the car safe to drive and safe for the people around me (I live in Cleveland, Ohio, so no one else here would do that, but we’ve got to have standards — even in troubled times). Is there any way I can make this car quieter for the time being? Last night I went like 90 on the freeway to burn some of the carbon deposits, and that seemed to make a difference, but it’s the same story today, like I’m cutting down a tree when I’m just trying to get to the store ($6 Digorno’s supreme pizza).

Something has happened to this engine to cause it to no longer be operating within it's designed parameters, due to one of the possibilities listed above. Because of this the parts are loose and are literally banging against each other, instead of sliding along each other on a thin film of oil, as designed.

        "body": "That does sound like a limp mode of some sort. Most cars have different stages of limp mode depending on what is going on with it. You need to scan for codes. You can have pending errors that do not light up the check engine light just yet. Most of the time with diesels it is either fuel issues like the fuel filter being clogged or issues with the turbo. I would check over the entire intercooler system. Make sure all the pipes are seated properly and do not appear to have holes/cracks in them. Not sure if yours has a VNT system on it, we don't get those in diesel here in the states so not familiar at all with it. But VNT malfunctions will cause low power as well. And that can cycle on and off as the car sees improvement in performance along the way. This is one of those tough to diagnose issues because it isn't acting up enough for the computer to complain about it. Not sure that this is a solution but it may point you in a direction of where to start looking.",

    "selftext": "Beginner classic truck help Hi, this is my first Reddit post so sorry if it’s weird… I just got my dream truck that I wanna fix up, an ‘86 Ford F150 Heritage Edition 5.0. I really wanna fix it up and use it regularly but I just don’t know where to start. I have a decent amount of mechanical knowledge but I’m no pro. It ran when I got it, I drove back home, let it sit awhile and tried to make some repairs but I think I made it worse tbh. I didn’t change anything major but now I’m just looking to start fresh after some advice. I guess I’m just curious where to start if anyone has any good suggestions. I don’t wanna upgrade the engine or do anything crazy to it. I just want the engine to run decent. This next part is the full story but you don’t have to read it… Here’s the full story if you wanna read: the truck was an old farm truck, but the farmer gave it to a mechanic for unknown reasons and I guess never came to pick it up. Mechanic let it sit for years and sold it to seller. I bought the truck from seller and it ran. It had a little trouble starting but we got it to crank and I drove it home. Maybe 30 miles, got on the highway and even pushed her to 70 mph. On the drive, I could tell the engine was having a hard time. Not getting full power, and struggling to idle. So, I got it home, parked it and got to work on some repairs that I thought would help. I added some engine cleaner to about half a tank of gas. Just the additive from Walmart. Changed the oil and filter, and flushed the coolant. I didn’t touch the tranny oil cuz I heard it was better not to if she wasn’t struggling. After the fluids, I moved to spark. I changed the plugs and wires, and distributor cap. Plugs came out clean, no oil or coolant in the pistons. Next, I wanted to make sure the air system was good, so I cleaned the throttle body, new air filter to start. After that, I tested it and she did pretty good. Got some more power and she seemed like she was running better on the road, but then the next issue was it would die if you let her idle. So, I did a bunch of googling and this is probably where I turned a small problem into something bigger…😅 so I tried playing with the idle screw first. I could get it to not die but the idle was around 1.8 and it just sounded way too high, but if I lowered it, it would rev up and down then die. After some googling, I ended up changing the throttle positioning sensor, the IAC which l believe stood for Idle Air Control valve, the fuel pressure regulator, and another sensor that I can’t remember right now. After that I tried to start it and it wouldn’t start. So I figured it had to be a fuel issue now and found a leak in the tank selector switch under the cabin so I just bypassed it with more fuel line. I’m only pulling from the rear tank. Lastly, I changed the fuel pump, but i think I put the wrong one in honesty because it looked a little different. After all that she won’t start anymore. The only thing I’d like to add is a buddy told me to look at the “vacuum system” but I can’t find anything on it. No how-to video or even diagram so I’m not sure what to do there. So, that’s where I’m at. Thank you to anyone who has some insight. I know I probably made a stupid mistake or did something unnecessary, but I’d appreciate any advice. Thanks for your time.",

I have had to replace the steering rack, radiator, starter, alternator etc. Another thing to think about is the timing belt and water pump. I have also had to replace suspension components and shock absorbers. This would be the same with any vehicle with that age and mileage.

    "selftext": "Hey guys and gals! Soo I’m looking into joining the world of trucks.. I decided I wanted to be more of a man and be capable of doing so much more and I can definitely see myself doing that with a truck.. having a truck would truly benefit my profession as an apprentice electrician, and a guy trying to make the most of the house my family owns by restoring it and adding onto it… I believe a truck will greatly help Currently I have about 6k saved up and I honestly am not interested in financing anything I wanted to see what you folks would recommend for a first timer, what truck is truly built with quality and is well known for reliability I was looking into the cat eye Chevy 1500s from 2006, but I wanted to see what you guys think Should I v6 or v8? Compact or full size ? Preferably four seater or extended cabin with seats Pretty much something I can make look real good while also being reliable Thank you!",

Under powered and honestly gas mileage savings isn't too much when you're loaded with tools. I haul about 500lbs of gear for work daily in my extended cab. You'll use/need the v8 in the electrician field. Wire is heavy. Trailers get pretty loaded. Plus in my experience the v6 is only available in the stripped down silverados. 5.3 is very nice. 6.0 may be over kill for what you're going to use it for. But if you score a nice 1500 HD with the 6.0 its not going to hurt. But they cost more. I've got an 03 cat eye z71 4wd extended cab. I've got a 4 inch lift, squatted down to a 2 inch lift with the weight and aligned to be that way. Very capable off road for hunting, not going to go everywhere but far enough. I've loaded it to the gills with supplies and even half a cord of wood. No problem. 100s of pounds of feed on top of my regular load all of it. I've pulled 6000 lbs of a load in a trailer with my regular 1500 no problem. Electrically they're nightmares. And cat eyes run from 03-07 so gives youva few years to search for. 6k in my area should get you into a decent truck with about 150k miles that's going to need some work. Maybe tires and brakes maybe a little more. I paid $6,000 for mine with 165k. Needed shocks , tires and brakes. Already had the lift kit on it. I've put about $1,000 in parts in mine since. Fuel pump, ac actuators, 4wd actuator. 4wd switch, just wrapped up a new ac system (compressor grenaded), radio, back up camera, speakers, remote start. And I still need to paint and fix the headliner. Typical cat eye... they look good two toned, there's a lot where I'm at because the roof and hood burn and it costs less to just two tone the truck. I love the functionality of 4 door. But I'm a sucker for the way the extended cab looks and my kids are used to it now. I think they look better. Single cabs are also always cool but really expensive. Extended cabs are the cheapest in my experience",

    "selftext": "So I have a 97 Toyota Rav 4 with 250,000km was in amazing condition until my oil pump seal or gasket went on a 3+ our drive. When I got home is had literally the least amount of oil on my dip possible stick while still having some. The leak has been fixed but after that the oil light flickers when at idles but not when driving. The mechanic checked the crank shaft for engine wear and said it was not too bad so he went back and replaced the oil pump. After new oil pump the Oil light stills flickers and the mechanic is now saying it must be due to engine wear from when it ran low on oil. The mechanic said it may run for a couple years with a flickering oil light since the damage wasn't too bad. My question is it possible for a car to last a couple years with a flickering oil light? Because to me low oil pressure is really bad. Also was wondering if thicker oil could help extend its life? How how much thicker can you go then 5w-30 if that's what is recommended? I would also be interested to hear why the oil light only came on after the leak was fixed?",

I own it so there are no monthly payments but it seems like every year I’m putting in $3k or more into the car. Left front strut has been a repetitive issue, and brakes seem to go quickly. I am the third owner of the car and I try to take care of it the best I can. My worry is it becomes a money pit, but new and used cars are expensive.

This past Tuesday it began popping on the driver side every-time I turned right. I took it to the mechanic and he told me it was most likely the CV axle was bad. Now here is the thing, I am a delivery driver and I work this weekend, and they won’t be able to fix my car until Monday. I want to know how long I can drive my car before I should become extremely concerned? Should I go to work or should I let my manager know I won’t be in for this weekend? Sidenote: I live in a small town and the furthest I would drive is about 10 minutes away (20 minute round trip)",

For a younger family member last year 2024, I found and got lucky with a Very Clean, garaged, rust-less 2010 Corolla with no problems and 90k on it....on Facebook marketplace asking an unbelievably low $7000 US in New Hampshire. I quickly messaged him \"I'll give you 7500 if we can see/show it asap-like-today\". That worked. I got it as he overlooked a few other replies on day 1.... but these gems for sale are too rare. While I can deal with older Subaru when not too rotten ; on subaru's under the hood, look for rust dust around A/C compressors and if you see an orange \"spray pattern\" (it would be tiny rust flying out around compressor pulley being driven by serpentine belt, or old school belt on wicked old subaru eg 200x.) A/C clutch compressor goes bad some years after that rust pattern appears. Here in New England, nothing older than 2010 has much of a body left, just mentioning the top thing you can SEE quickly. More likely, for 5k,6k,more.. at best you'll find double the mileage, more rust, look hard at the jack points and body underneath, and bring a rolling floor jack with you (asking in advance \"mind if I jack up the front wheels before a quick road test?\"), bring a wrench friend or learn how to jack up each side's control arm ...hmm, bring a friend/mechanic to check ball joints,bearings at least. Did I mention that the jack points will \"show \" an old body nearing end of life...like, you put jack on correct front(heavier) jack point ; the body starts lifting,,,you HEAR crunchy noises and you're actually deforming the body a little, rust flakes start falling, you take a peek and SEE that the rusty jack point is deforming itself, so whether or not you got the wheels all the way up and off the ground, you definitely wanna mentally stop there and back out. Finally the engine. Glad you didn't mention \"fast/power is good!\" Save your money down the road and aim for a roughly 2-itre (NOT a 1.5L honda for example, but a 2.0L is a good size/engine withOUT a turbo. Do not buy any turbo engine, never driven genttly by prev owner, less room under the hood, turbo parts dying early and all that hot-rodding chews up the auto transmission.

I couldn't find anything about finland on the internet almost like it didnt exist!!. I kept searching and changing my wording and questions then I figured instead of asking about snow removal questions I'd check and see their older vehicles conditions to see if it was worth the hassle. To my amazement their vehicles that i found for sale were pristine. So I searched up vehicles I've owned and seen in canada and older versions I knew where they rusted , and decided to look at chevy silverados 1500s (1990- 2006). I'm now looking at the nicest trucks I've seen in those years. For what is dirt cheap or the same you would pay for them in canada. I'm now even more curious as to how or why this is happening ?",

Anti rust undercoating is popular in the Nordics, and most car brands have that applied by the dealers or importers if it wasn't done by the factory. So that's one big factor in rust prevention, good undercoating can delay the onset of rust under the car by at least five or six years even if it isn't re-done periodically. I understand this is less common on the American continent, for whatever reason.",

I could be very wrong, as the following is an assumption, but it's probably a grey or gold colored vehicle. It could just be the undercoat of your vehicle though. 100% was another vehicle attempting to park backwards. The perfectly horizontal scratches are only possible if something grazed across that area while pressing into it, in a perfectly straight motion. If this was a tree branch or object you hit while driving, the scratches wouldn't be so perfectly straight. Edit to add: After second look, it actually looks like the dent on the side is caused by the rear bumper of a pickup truck, though again that's speculation, so take it with a grain of salt. Also, even if someone were carrying a grand piano past and dropped it there, it wouldn't cause that much damage. Definitely had to be backed into.",

I've heard a lot of shit about GC's with the 4.7, but I also had a pretty good experience with mine. It was a 1999, the first year of that engine and body style, and literally the only engine-related issue I had was having to replace the O2 sensor at probably around 100k-120k (I bought it in 2007 with around 70k-80k miles). I traded it to a family member who had no issues and drove it well past 200k. I had to do some other stuff to mine, the major issue was that it seemed to chew through bearings (2 sets in the 8 years I had it). I also had to replace the radiator around the same time as the O2 sensor. Never left me stranded.",

Yesterday my check engine light came on again and I took it to Autozone, they said it’s coding for a lose or faulty gas cap. I went back to the dealer and replaced the gas cap because better to be safe than sorry. My main question is is how long does it take for the check engine light to clear, and is the Autozone code reader accurate? I don’t know if it’s just a general diagnosis or if it’s more specific. Luckily I have a warranty for what work I got done by the dealer and since this is fuel related I’d hope they wouldn’t charge me. But any advice would be greatly appreciated coming got a girl who has really bad anxiety and is struggling financially, I’m already in the hole from the last repairs I had to get done and I just got this car less than a year ago..😞",

I just asked a dealer located about 22 miles from my shop what their procedure would be for that inspection IF I wish to proceed, and their immediate reply was \"we don't let our vehicles go that far.\" It's a (used car) dealer with decent reviews everywhere I look. 4.5- 4.7 stars plus.

When my friend tried to register it at the DMV, they said the title needs a notarized signature from the owner. We called the seller, and when I mentioned the name on the title, he claimed I had the wrong number. After my friend finally got in touch with him, he told my friend he would send the notarized signature, but now he’s stopped responding. Since the notary requires the seller’s ID and consent, my friend is stuck with a car he can’t legally register. What are his options? Is there any legal recourse, or is he out of luck?",

    "selftext": "Hi! So looking for maybe some advice, some opinions. My dad has been the only owner of his FJ Cruiser since he bought it new in 2007. It is a six speed manual transmission, and it has a lot of miles on it. It is in good shape, runs great, and he would probably keep it if he could, but at this point, he would like to sell it to get something more gas friendly for my teenage siblings to drive. After doing some research, we have found that they have held their value pretty well, however, I have not seen many with as many miles as his has on it. Just wondering if anyone could give me some insight! I'll try to find a few photos to add as well. Thanks in advance!",

Other cars with smaller motors that are loud when revving tend to have aftermarket exhausts and the rest of the vehicles produced tend to just have regular exhausts. You’re still going to hear those vehicles but it’s not going to be anything crazy, my car is a 3.5 twin turbo and even when I have the pedal all the way to the floor is doesn’t sound the same as a Scat Pack or even a Charger R/T because their stock exhaust is made to accentuate the sound while mine it made to make it more luxurious. My point in saying this is so that you know it’s not you doing anything wrong your car probably just doesn’t have the exhaust to really make those deep rumble sounds when revving. That being said next time you drive under an underpass give the gas a little hit, you won’t really gain that much speed, if there’s no one behind me and I’m in the mood I’ll slow down about 10 mph before going under a long underpass and then step on it for a few seconds while I’m under there to hear it.",

    "selftext": "I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question, so sorry in advance, but I want to know how much my grandma’s car is worth before we discuss her selling it to me. It’s a 2017 Volkswagen Beetle that she bought brand new. I’m not sure exactly how many miles it has, but I know it’s on the lower side because she hasn’t been able to drive it for quite some time. It has some scratches but other than that has no external or internal damages. My mom says it’s not worth buying but I respectfully disagree, especially since my current car is kind of a death trap.",

While the current is relatively low (20–150 mA), even small amounts of current can cause muscle contractions and pain. You would likely experience an intense, sharp electrical shock which could cause involuntary muscle contractions, possibly making you unable to let go. If you want to feel shock from a spark plug, I suggest holding the tip of a spark plug on a pull start lawn mower (10-20kV and 20-60mA). At least there you don't run the risk of continual shock.

Also unfortunate to have to mention, but being a younger woman, it's very useful to have some understanding of your car so that in the instances you DO have to take it to a mechanic... you are less likely to be taken advantage of, if you can pick up when a shop is bullshitting with you or trying to upsell/prey on your obvious concern!

My question is do you guys think it’s a good idea to do the deal (with some negotiations included within the coming months) since I do want a bmw but it’d be my 2nd car in the same year I got the Honda civic. I do plan on doing most of maintenance of my cars myself since with the help of my dad who’s a diesel mechanic can help me learn about all the parts n stuff but I do have to be worried about insurance cost mostly since gas and parts probably won’t be an issue since I drive every so often but not daily (which is use the bmw as a daily driver if I do end up doing the deal)",

But now we are debating if we should just sell the car as is or if it would be worth it to repair the audio situation. We still owe about $6,000 on it so I’m leaning towards it’s not worth it but I have no idea how that will impact the resell of it.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm facing some frustrating issues with my 2012 Skoda Superb 1.8 TSI (Petrol, Manual) and would really appreciate some advice. The Problems: I often get error messages like: \"Button for driver assistance system faulty\" \"Brakes! Visit workshop!\" As soon as these errors appear: The instrument cluster dies. The AC stops working. The cooling fans start running at high speed. If I continue driving after these warnings, an oil pressure warning appears after driving a few kilometers. Despite these issues, the engine continues to run, but if I turn it off, it won't restart. When Does It Happen? These issues mostly occur on a cold start. After driving for a while, the car works fine until the next cold start. If the errors appear mid-drive, the engine keeps running, but the above issues (cluster, AC, fans) persist. What I've Tried: Recently replaced the battery, but the issues persist. Replaced the OBD module, but that didn’t resolve the problem. Installed an on/off switch on the OBD module, which temporarily resolves the problem when toggled. The Biggest Challenge: When the issue occurs, the ECU won’t communicate with the diagnostic scanner, making it difficult to diagnose the root cause. I've attached a video as well in which you can see that the car engine is running and the error is intermittent. I'm hoping someone here has faced similar issues or can suggest possible causes and solutions. Any insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance for your help!",

    "selftext": "I have a 2020 Honda HRV and if it sits for 3 or 4 days it will not start. The dealership says this is normal. I have replaced the battery every January for a total of 4 batteries. If it is 35 degrees or lower, it will not start – even if I had just driven it the day before. If it sits for 3 or 4 days, it won’t start. I have had it in the shop several times and they have done a quick check on the battery but won’t do anymore. I recently took it to the dealership and told them to fix it or I was trading it in. They checked for a parasitic draw and did not find anything. After expressing my disgust with the car, they did run another test but still said that this is normal for newer cars because of all the safety features. They say that ALL new cars are like this now because of the electrical demands of the features. I think this is ridiculous that a car cannot sit a full week and still start. I work from home and generally drive my car once or twice a week but occasionally I do go over a week without driving it. I know several other people who have a Honda, and they do not have this issue. My mom’s Tucson will sit for 3 weeks and will start every time. I am fed up with this car and having to charge the battery every time I want to go somewhere, and I am trading it in (even though I love the car in every other way.) So my questions are this: Does anyone else have this problem? Is this normal for Honda that you must start them every 3 or 4 days or the battery will die? When I trade it in, what compact SUV would be a better choice – saying that it is not true that ALL new cars are this way. Now I am nervous of getting another car that gives me the same problems",

The bolsters in the Altima are sort of flat - see photo - and I am fine with them In newer cars the bolsters all stick up more and dig into my hips. Luxury cars, budget cars, all of them irritate me. (In case you are wondering, I’m 5’11” and 200 pounds, so pretty average size) If I was to buy a newish Camry, or Honda, or Volvo I would try to get over it.

And looking at the wheel placement, it is compressed back closer to the cabin than the middle. My questions are: is this an alignment issue, or indicative of a bigger issue? Related question is, do I bring it back to the tire dealer or seek out a GM endorsed repair shop for this fix? Pictures of the front end, driver's side, and passenger's side included.",

We bought the new carburetor, put it on, connected all the hoses and everything. Obviously the new carburetor isn’t tuned properly. We go to start the car up to heat it to temp and tune it, this car does not have an rpm gauge so it is hard to figure out where to tune it to the proper setting. What it is doing, is it will seem like it is idling fine when running after tuning but when you go to press on the gas (in park) the carburetor will bog down almost as if it is getting too much air and try to cut out if not given the gas slowly enough. Does anyone know how to fix this issue? (Also not sure if relevant, this is a 1.6L engine, 3 speed automatic, and a 2 barrel carb)",

And when that doesn't happen, the car tends to go sideways from the wheels locking up. Which is bad. You might have never even noticed because you have to be going pretty fast and slam on them. You will feel the pedal pulsate. That's the abs. If you've ever slid on snow, you know exactly what I'm talking about. You don't have to be going that fast on snow and the car can just tell it's moving when you don't want it to. So what you do is drive like a grandpa or grandma in the rain or snow. Brake earlier and pump the brakes with your foot. You dont have to be fast, push the pedal then release then push and aim on slowing down from further away in increments. Otherwise in normal weather, you will be fine as long as you don't drive like a shithead.",

The hooks that go in the door jamb are not universal. Car door jambs come in all shapes and sizes. \"Universal\" is a lie told by these garbage ass \"brands\" based in China who don't test fit products. Buy from a reputable brand like Yakima or Thule, who actually test fit their products on real vehicles and have confirmed fits. They have different fit kits for each vehicle to give a near custom fit. As for this time, you should be lucky no one was behind you and got into an accident avoiding your gear and got injured. Do yourself, and everyone else on the road, a favor and throw that rack in the garbage and start over with a quality product. I assure you the cost of a good roof rack is **far** less than you'll be looking at if your stuff falls off again and you injure someone and get sued into bankruptcy. 🤷‍♂️",

    "selftext": "Listen, I know I’m going to get dragged for this, it’s not a troll post just genuine curiosity. I have a 2024 turbocharged car, it’s rated at 260HP, but pushes around 210-220 range to the wheels to prevent damaging the CVT, which can support up to 300lbTq.. I’m not looking to put “big” numbers down or push anything too much, I’d really just like the true HP figure to the wheels, maybe an extra 7psi(would be around 20psi) from the little spooly thing. I’m looking to achieve this with simple bolt on intake and charge pipe, easy to revert parts… and obviously a tune, but I don’t want to void my warranty to achieve the true power figures. This is where my question comes in, I’m pondering getting a second ECU, one with a tune and one without, but if it would come up on a scan or something, I’m going to scrap the entire idea and get a slightly faster car.",

In “I” mode it’s pushing 12lbs of boost, in “S#” mode it’s about 15psi, I wanna touch 20psi but need a tune to do so. The reason I want to swap the ECU instead of just throwing a tune at it , is so I can have a ECU that’s tuned and one that’s stock, so when I inevitably shred my CVT, I can revert the ecu back to the stock one and bring it in for warranty work.. like replacing my CVT. - *if they wouldn’t be able to tell that I was swapping the ECU back and fourth* Also, no intention on actually touching the TCM, but the concept of my question is the same IF I decided to go that route too. I understand at the crank it’s pushing 260, but I want that to the wheels not just the crank. 212hp to 260hp isn’t a huge difference on paper, but it’s a noticeable power difference considering I’ve driven a tuned CVT WRX that was sitting at 275range. They do have a slightly beefier CVT, but they’re all rated at about 300lbtq, you can push over 300HP but they’re torque and inevitable heat is where the issue arise.",

For example it could be a clogged fuel injector or bad fuel pump. I just had this issue on my car and it ended up being a PCV valve that went bad. My recommendation would be to check in this order; Air leaks, fuel treatment (injector cleaner or seafoam), PCV. Then I would take it to your Husbands friend for anything past that since you’re not mechanically inclined and probably don’t have tools to check fuel pressure etc. Hope this helps and good luck!",

Otherwise, if the claim is processed, the car will be purchased by the insurance company at market value before the damage. You can then purchase the vehicle from them, but the title will be branded as a salvage vehicle (meaning it was totaled by the insurance company which means the repairs exceed 70% of the value of the vehicle). Once the title is branded, it is what it is and can't be changed. That is for consumer protection so someone can't sell a salvage/totaled vehicle as a clean title.

Is the distortion caused by the glass or the coating? 2. If it's caused by the coating, is this sort of distortion common with aquapel? If so, I would probably not have it done again. 3. If it's caused by the windshield, does replacing a windshield cause stress or wear and tear to the car? Any help would be much appreciated! :) EDIT: I'm trying to add a video for context.

Car has been off for hours. I did nothing for it to start.This is the second time I've heard this. The first was couple weeks ago I could hear it from the exterior. Car had been parked for hours then as well. Related, tire pressure light has been on while all tires are fully pumped up.\" The question was answered, something about the fuel evaporation system and a need to change the TPSs (I have an appointment to do that in about a week). My question is that if it is OK to leave it while it hums? My parking lot is a bit away from my appartment complex and I can't just turn the car on to stop the humming. I have a 2hr 1 way commute to my town from where i currently am, and then a 2hr 1 way commute back to the city next weekend for my appointment at the dealership but I don't know if it is OK to do that with the car.",

I have one of these, they're lovely cars - but there's a few things to know: 1). The cooling system is very plastic and very shit, they're prone to cracking at the thermostat housing (front of the engine, up top), and the bottom of the coolant overflow reservoir (the one you can access easily up near the windsheild). The thermostat housing needs to be replaced with an aftermarket aluminium unit, any competent euro shop can do that. The coolant reservoir near the windscreen will fail in one of two obvious ways: either by showing a low coolant warning, or by a strong sweet smell (and also probably a low coolant warning). In either case, get that stupid coolant bottle replaced. 2). The timing hardware (chain guides/tensioner interfaces) are also made of plastic. If you've got any receipts, go looking for a receipt covering the replacement of the timing chain & tensioner & associated front-of-engine hardware. If you don't have those receipts, budget for that getting replaced. Cost me $1800 about 8 years ago, so consider it $2-$2,500 by now (depending on where you are). 3). These cars have \\*all\\* kinds of weird electrical problems caused by a failing battery. Like, seriously, any weird kind of gremlinny inexplicable issue with an electrical bent: go get the battery checked. You may find really annoying problems are super easily fixed with just a new battery. 4). Some car manufacturers are helpful, others aren't. [JaguarForums.com](http://JaguarForums.com) is absolutely the former; they are knowledgeable and helpful, seriously a great experience I wish I had when I owned a Mercedes. Otherwise, these are incredible cars to drive; really great, linear power delivery, smooth, quiet, and comfortable. I drove mine 3,000 miles on a road trip vacation in 2021. Loved every second.

At the rear of the engine is the flywheel, connected to this is a clutch pack, then your transmission case, power is transferred via gears inside the transmission with linkage levers to select gears.

        "body": "The best way to diagnose this is with the factory scan tool, however since that's likely not available, I'd hazard a guess and say the handbrake switch is not calibrated correctly. (especially considering the recent repair) The cars computer looks for several signs to disengage the cruise control, often the brake pedal switch as well as the brake lights, on manuals the clutch pedal, brake fluid pressure in the ABS unit, and also the handbrake are taken into account as to whether or not to disengage ABS. What I'd check is to see how far you have to pull up the handbrake for the handbrake light in the dash to come on. Depending on where you're from it can look like [this](https://www.powerstop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BRAKE.png), [this](https://www.powerstop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Presentation1.png) or [this](https://www.powerstop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Exclamation.png)… or some combination of these icons. You should be able to pull it at least a few millimeters before the light comes on, and you should be able to release it and let it rest totally flat. If all seems good there, then the next thing I'd check would be the brake lights. See if you can park with the back of the car facing a window so you can see the reflection of the brake lights. Make sure all the lights come on solid, including the center high-mount stop light, and make sure they all go out consistently when you release the brake. Also check to see how sensitively they come on. There should be little but still a bit of brake pedal travel before they engage. If that's good too, then your next step would require a dealer scan tool, because you'll need to talk to the ABS system to see if it's seeing brake fluid pressure when none should be there (i.e. when the brake pedal is not being pressed). This could be an indicator of a mechanical problem or a sensor problem. Lastly, if you have the dealer scan tool, you should be able to see why cruise control is being denied or disengaged in the PCM's data PIDs. (PIDs are the data that the computer provides).",

I’ve reported to LE and only considered this a possibility after 3 different mechanics looked at what my lights are/have been doing/heard interference on all audio sources and all said it seems like someone intentionally tampered with the harness based on what they could see under the hood/hear from the speakers. Also worth noting the individual in question made a point to express their ability to do such things outright (don’t worry - left them shortly after 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️) Timeline ⬇️⬇️⬇️ **EDITED to add that a couple months prior to the below, I came out one morning to my car COMPLETELY dead - had just gotten new battery and had not been left on/lights automatically shut off in 2020 model/know for a fact there was no reason for this to have occurred - to the extent that my key fob didn’t even work to unlock the door. The only remaining electrical function before jumping it was the bottom left front orange small drive light. I first became aware of there being an issue when my front right headlight started to go out last July. I originally had no reason to think this was related as I figured the bulb just needed to be replaced. Fast forward about a month and a half (mid-September), it had gone entirely out and my front left started to periodically not work. I took it to O’Reilly’s to get the bulb replaced (they typically do it as the Hyundai sockets are a little wonky and difficult to secure if you don’t know what it’s supposed to feel like) and even though they were able to get a bulb into the right socket, the replacement bulb didn’t relight (was not a bulb defect - that was confirmed). I noticed during that interaction, too, that the light switch settings (switch is traditional version on my steering column) also bizarrely seemed to be out of sync with their intended settings. I.e. My drive lights continued to work at that time when switch was set to off, but not auto or fog when they also should have been lit. About 2 months later, my other headlight went out - same issue, after dimming gradually over time and bulb replacement did nothing. A week after, my rear drive lights stopped working. My brake lights and blinkers still work… make it make sense 😩 Not related to recalls, have checked. No impact to interior lights of any kind or dashboard controls. No issues with audio controls other than an immense amount of interference (happens with aux connection, Bluetooth, and radio - doesn’t sound like “radio static” - very clearly is some sort of electrical interference.) Trying to decide if any of this is worth repairing as I know if it is the harness, it’s gonna be a ridiculous job. Just trying to figure out what specifically could have been done to cause this before I take the car for diagnostics so I can make sure they document it for LE before doing anything. Thanks y’all 💯",

    "selftext": "Hear me out, I have a 2014 Taurus that is amazing! but, it’s turning 12 next year. This lead me to asking around with this question. With how new vehicles are being made, is it worth it invest in an older car if it’s in great condition? All the new cars that are placed in the lower end price ranges, they’re just full of problems, I’ve had three close friends experience this. If I were to replace my Taurus with an equivalent car, I’ll be dropping 60-70k just for a new car to be worth a 50ish thousand car from 2014. I’m at the point where I want more boost sounds 😏(cold air intake), but if I want to keep having fun, I have to actually spend the money for maintenance of all these 11 year old drivetrain parts (the torque converter, for example). What do y’all think? Do I say screw it and rock this car until it explodes or rusts out (I’m in Michigan btw), or buy a new one and have two turbos? ;) The car: 2014 Ford Taurus, limited, 2.0 with the turbo, FWD. images attached because I have yet to see an exactly copy of my baby 😂",

I also have some body rust on the vehicle, so im sure the underside probably isn't good either (i've never looked). the computer has also always been messed up, so the check engine light has been on since i got it 4 years ago. last month, my light started flashing every once and a while when on the highway. my mechanic started with an oil change (i was 1500 miles past my due date oops), and that solved it for a little. then, it flashed again while trying to pass someone uphill-and that's when my car started getting bad. it significantly lost a lot of engine power, i hear it revving up almost when switching gears (if that makes sense?) i'm afraid to go past 45. it also makes a constant quiet high pitched humming noise while on the road. however, when it's time for the car to switch gears, even though it's loud and scares me it doesn't have problems switching back and forth-even as it revs in between each gear. i think i'm partially just afraid to be rough with it in its condition so i'm being really easy while driving on it-I also had my transmission looked at about 6 months ago and it was allegedly fine. i took it back to the shop and had all of my spark plugs changed, and my 2nd ignition coil was changed as well (was showing a misfire there). ran codes again and still had a misfire, so they checked my compression and swapped my #2 and #4 injectors. I also paid for my fuel rail to be drained and to check the pressure. i've had it back for the week and it drives better but still not good at ALL. after clearing all of my codes, my check engine light came back on in two days (kind of expected because of my past computer problems). my mechanic told me to check if my car \"rattles\" and then it might be the catalytic converter. i wouldn't consider this \"rattling\" (referring to the attached video), but my car does vibrate while driving. it's not enough for me to physically notice, but when i look over at my phone or purse i see it moving. also this morning after parking at work (in idle) it almost felt like i hit a bump under my seat. it only happened about 3 times in a 10 minute period while running my car. i tried my best to record the noise it's making, im not sure if i recorded in the right area because again i know NOTHING about cars. i feel like im driving a bomb 💀 honestly i'm just trying to get it to last until summer so i can save a little longer for a new car bc money troubles, but i just need some help solving this if possible! thank you and sorry for the long paragraph :)",

        "body": "So, your catalytic converter is the part of your exhaust system that filters out the emissions to make it better for the environment. They get clogged from time to time, and will trigger a check engine light. What will also trigger a check engine light, however, is a bad O2 sensor. Basically, your car doesn't recognize that the air it's sucking in has enough oxygen to burn, and it'll make your car run rough because of the mixture it requires. That sounds to me like your converter is clogged, or your running rough because of an O2 sensor. You can get the converter replaced (pretty expensive, and what you should do) if you live in a state that doesn't have yearly car inspections, you could also have someone cut it off and weld a pipe to replace it. You aren't doing any favors to the environment if you don't buy a new catalytic converter. If it's an O2 sensor, those are pretty cheap. And easy to fix. Also, if your check engine light ever starts flashing, PULL OVER IMMEDIATELY. A normal Check Engine Light will usually be fine to continue where you're headed, but a flashing one means you may be causing serious damage to the engine.",

My MP3 player has Bluetooth lucky, but it’s not like Apple. Is there any way to connect non-phone devices to modern cars so I can play my music?

    "selftext": "Hi Reddit, the title says it all. I'm shopping for my first car and I think I’ve done enough research to narrow it down to either a 2013 Honda Civic EX or a 2013 Toyota Corolla S. I'm leaning more towards the Civic because of its looks and performance, but I'm definitely not overlooking the Corolla. I came across this Civic that has 177k miles on it, and the dealer’s out-the-door price is around $10k. It has a clean record, and I checked the Carfax, but I know Carfax can’t be 100% accurate. I haven't test-driven it yet. I checked the value of the car on CarEdge, and it comes out to about $3500, with $4800k being the maximum. I also found a 2013 Corolla S with around 170k miles on it, and the asking price is $7,000. So my question is: is either of these worth buying? What should I look for before purchasing? Are there any common issues that might come up with these models? I'd appreciate your thoughts, along with the best price I should pay and any car knowledge for first-time buyers you can share.

Then I turned it off, cleaned the inside, turned it off after a few minutes, and when I was done it no longer turned on. I replaced the battery, and my fuses. I’ll list a few of the things I’ve noticed below. • I noticed I do not have a fuel relay, Im unsure if that is relevant to my car at all. • My check engine light is on • My belt is turning • My car will turn on, but will struggle and the engine shakes • Some of the fuses are loose now, new and old. They are the correct ones. Any advice would be appreciated. I have no idea what I’m doing, I have been incredibly lucky and have always taken care of my car.

I know diagnosing on the internet is impractical, but I seriously have no idea at this point and am fishing for answers. Long post, but please read! I need help! I made a post in a few mechanic subs asking for help with this, and the answers were inconclusive. I've gathered more information since that post and am still coming up empty. I'm hopeful to get more input and ideas of what to check. My truck (2012 F150 5.0, 180k miles) smells noxious. It's almost like rotten eggs. The first assumption, of course, is the catalytic converter. I ran an OBD reader (not just a simple code puller) on 3 different occasions, 3 different drives, and 3 different days. The data every time was consistent. Fuel load is in spec, o2 sensors are reading properly. There are no engine codes at all. Cat temperature is proper. No known (though entirely possible) exhaust leaks. There's no ticking or rumbling that would give away an exhaust leak. I've ruled out low quality fuel. I just performed an oil change, no gas in the oil. No leaks. Nothing burning out the tail pipe. The battery is in good shape. Minor corrosion on both posts, but not extreme. I've considered cleaning it up to see if the smell goes away. I recently got new front calipers, pads, and rotors (about 1 month ago). I got them professionally inspected last weekend, and they verified they're working perfectly. This is the only repair that has been made, and the smell started within 48 hours of the repair. This does NOT smell like bedding/burning brakes. The smell seems to occur without braking. I put the truck in neutral and coasted to a stop on an empty road. Once the truck stopped. The smell popped up. It dissipated after about 30 seconds, and it does this every time I stop/creep with the truck. It also occurs when I'm just idling the engine and not driving. It comes through the vents, and sometimes, it's extremely faint when I leave the truck. The interior is clean and free of garbage. I'm totally thrown for a loop. I've never encountered this before with no obvious causes. Thanks for reading. All input is helpful!",

Are with if you handy with tools? If so, get something thin and plastic (a guitar pick will do or something similar) and pry the trim (plastic surround) out from around the head unit (technical term for stereo). Behind this trim piece there will be 4 bolts that are either a T25 or a T30 size (the six point star one) remove these bolts and the whole head unit will be able to slide out and then you can check behind the head unit and inspect the connections, if possible fully remove them and reinstall them and see if that works.

The wiring is intact and the electrics still work. I have my MOT booked next Monday (this happened Sunday night). I can’t work out how it was attached to start with, it looks as if it was glued to me (I know nothing about cars). It did manually fold in before though so I don’t think it can have just been glued. Does anyone know if this can be repaired? Or if I need to get a new one? And how I can do that before my car fails it’s MOT 😭 I appreciate the help",

My car (Mercedes A160 2004) recently started to acting up, I’ve never had any issue with the car for as long as I own it apart from small issues here and their due to age. The car sometimes has a hard time switching gears, recently I noticed that if I stop and turn the car off and press the breaks a few times and then turn it on the gears switch normally, apart from that I don’t move it that often and if i don’t turn it on for a day or so the gears still work fine after until the problem re appears! I’ve been thinking to take it to the mechanic but last time i asked the mechanic the dude said “we will replace the gear box” or something and asked me an insane amount of money for a car that is 21 years old. Anyone had any similar experience? Could valvolines cause this? Thank you in advance",

Will this still increase acceleration at all or am I just going to he losing traction on a single tire all the time now? (My cars current diff is 2.65 I believe, with a 5 speed transmission)",

A pair of good tires and not flooring it on gravel should fix traction issues I may run into. I hope.

So I got new coolant assembly fans. When I got my car back from the mechanic my temperature gauge as well as my gas hand were acting up. Going up and down. The gas hand ended up going back to normal. But the temperature gauge was still exactly at the sailboat and under. I checked my coolant today saw it was almost empty and it looks brownish. I put some water in it. I take it upon myself to opened the radiator cap because I kind thought I overfilled the coolant and nothing but hot water it looks like shot out. Now my temperature gauge is above the sailboat and its smoke coming from out under the hood did I mess up something ? Do I need a coolant flush .

The smoke is obviously caused by you spilling coolant all over your engine bay it’s just evaporating from the heat. You need to take your car back to the shop and let the professionals deal with it. And another tip your car was perfectly fine before you messed with it the sail boat or middle indicator is telling you that your coolant is at operating temperature by messing with your coolant system you cause the system temps to rise and that’s why the needle is now in the red",

        "body": "The thermostat moving manually doesn't mean it is in proper working order. They usually have a wax pellet in it that melts at a certain temp and allows the thermostat to open. You can test this by placing it in hot water. Hotter than whatever it is designed to open at. You can also test it without removing it by feeling the upper and lower radiator hoses. Only one should get hot at first. When the engine reaches operating temp, the thermostat will open, and coolant will flow through the cooler hose to the radiator, making them both hot. If they both heat up at the same rate, your thermostat is stuck open usually. If the temp of both hoses never equalize, the thermostat is usually stuck closed. Does it keep overheating when you have the proper level of coolant in the vehicle? Did you bleed/burp the system to make sure you do not have an air bubble in the system? Does the cooling fan cut on? You said you have coolant loss, but no milkey oil, and im assuming no visible leaks. That generally means it is burning. The head gasket can also fail in a manner that coolant enters the combustion chamber and is burned off and exits the exhaust. Do you have white smoke coming out of the exhaust even after it is warmed up? Does the exhaust smell odd? You can likely rent an exhaust gas detector, or buy a cheap one. You put a special fluid in it, and put it over the cooling system cap. It will turn a certain color if there are exhaust gasses present in the cooling system. You can definitely rent a cooling system pressure tester and check if you have any leaks. Does it look like any coolant is overflowing from the cooling system pressure cap? The caps can go bad, not hold the proper pressure before venting to the res, lowering the boiling point of your coolant. Make sure the cap is in good condition, and the cap PSI rating matches the PSI your vehicle was designed to operate at. I have seen brand new caps cause issues because it was rated for the wrong pressure The heat will generally help bleed excess temperature from your cooling system. That is how it gets the air hot. It is a last ditch, not very effective method of preventing overheating, though. That should only be used in emergency, i gotta get home or to a safe place, situations.",

I've dealt with them, handing out bans, deleting posts, and giving feedback to the users. I hope this experience doesn't make you more weary of asking questions in the future. People sometimes forget that different people have different levels of knowledge in different things, and some questions tend to draw more attention from the general crowd than the dedicated users at /r/carquestions that do their best at offering sound and respectful advice. I hope you feel comfortable enough to ask any other questions you have again in the future. Also, just to summarize the advice: It's somewhat unlikely for a brake pad to fall out of your car, though it is possible. If you haven't noticed any difference in braking performance or any weird sounds when braking (as you've said) then odd are you're probably ok. That being said: If it's been a while since your last service (more than 6 months) it may be a good idea to take your car in for a service an inspection just to make sure the brake pad ISN'T yours. If it IS yours, not only can it cause braking issues which are dangerous, but it will cause catastrophic damage to your rotor and calipers, taking a job that could cost a couple hundred dollars, to one that could cost near 1000 dollars. So if your car hasn't been checked out in at least the last 6 months, take it in for an inspection, regardless of how it's doing. There's more than just the brakes that get checked for an inspection, and even if your brakes are fine, it's good to keep an eye on everything else too, just to make sure you're going down the road safely.",

Its most likely from someone else that worked on their car and left it there before you parked your car OR someone put it there purposely to play some kinda mind games with you. Again, it cant be yours since you haven’t noticed any difference in noises or braking performance. If it was yours, that would mean your caliper was stolen overnight or loose to a point it came off the knuckle assembly, then you would have a hell of mess on the ground with! Have a good day!",

Thats your brake rotor. There’s a weird knuckle-looking thing that will be sandwiching it on one side, almost like it’s grabbing your brake rotor (which it does). The knuckly thing is called your caliper. And between the caliper and the brake rotor on **both sides** should be one of these, your brake pads. Sometimes you can see this easily from outside the wheel, but most likely you will have to kneel or lay on the ground to look behind the tire. As long as you’ve got two on every rotor, you’re good. But this is also a chance to see how much material you have left. As the material gets thinner, it should eventually engage a little tab that will squeal when you brake to let you know the material is running low.

    "selftext": "Hi I have a 2023 Kia Niro phev. Only bought it 2 weeks ago. Today an engine temp warning came on, on the dash. There's a thermometer symbol, filled half way in blue. Next to it is an engine coolant symbol which is white. I understand that the engine coolant symbol would be in red if it's dangerous to drive the car. But that light is WHITE. Does this mean that the car is safe to drive? I had a low pressure tyre warning for the last few days - one of the front tyres was ranging from 33 to 36 as I was driving, but I didn't get around to getting it checked out. Would that tyre pressure problem cause the engine coolant temp warning? Dunno if the car is safe to drive right now!! Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks Deirdre",

I was breaking but could feel something pushing forward anyway. I let off the break tapped the gas and regained control pretty fast and stopped normally. It was intense to the point I thought I was rear ended. But I looked in the mirror and the car behind was 10 feet back. I pulled over but I didn't notice any damage at all and drove normal after that. I've been burning oil. My first thought is maybe the engine seized? Transmission issue? Abs? I'm going to get it evaluated. Did anyone expierence this before? What caused it?",

Unfortunately I don’t think it is worth making such a large investment to repair it. The car is a 2015 CX-9 Touring front-wheel drive with just under 130k miles on it. I bought it less than two years ago (with 115k miles on it) so I’d really love to get as much money back for it as possible. What are some options to consider for getting the most money I can get for it even though it doesn’t run and would need a new engine? Another consideration is that I have almost brand new winter tires on it that I’d love to have back to sell separately. I would appreciate any advice you all may have on either of these questions, thank you!",

        "body": "Find out what is exactly wrong with it. \"you need a new engine\" doesn't cut the mustard, I personally need to know exactly what is wrong with my vehicles as everything is replacable. is there a gaping hole in the block, is the block cracked in half, did the cooling system fail causing the block to get overheated which warped the head causing coolant and oil to mix, are the cylinders scored or damaged, is the crankshaft in bluetooth mode ie broken in half or with spinning cam journals? Did it spin a rod? There are so many problems that can cause a engine to fail to run and just being told \"it needs a new engine is a very poor diagnosis, like that's obvious from a basic stand point but what are the fundamental problems with it as you can salvage different types of damage, if the block is cracked in half then yeah it's toast and the internals could be salvaged and parted out to get some money, no one wants second hand bearings, but a decent cam shaft and forged pistons and con rods will be sellable. You'd get more views and interest even in a broken non running vehicle if you found the exact problems and saved someone else the headache of trying to guestimate as that causes potential buyers to avoid your vehicle unless they are looking to just rob it of panels and body parts and interior parts etc. Not many people want to buy second hand tyres, unless you're selling all the wheels as a set as people are more interested in undamaged alloys or decent quality unrusted steel wheels than they are a set of used tyres even if they are a high quality branded tyre, yet if you sold them as an entire set someone would probably think Oh yeah i can buy them and swap them out come winter or replace the tyres and have much better quality rims! Like i have curb damaged alloys on my 2012 kia ceed 1.6 crdi and i'd love to buy a set that are in decent quality that are cheaper than brand new. If you have the space and tools, strip it completely, you can sell pretty much everything as parts or as sets ie radiator and coolant hoses, intercooler and hoses, intake system, manifolds, exhaust, suspension and steering components, brake calipers and abs/wheel speed sensors. A junk yard will give you a poor estimation based on their initial observation which is never indepth and usually way below what you'd get if you parted the vehicle or identified the issue and sold it to someone who could fix it.",

The vehicle overheated due to an empty cooling system, and the coolant may have also mixed with the oil due to blown head gaskets and or a crack in the head or block. The coolant mixing with the engine oil caused improper lubrication resulting in internal engine damage.” Their recommendation was to replace the engine since it was making a sound in the lower block, cost estimate was $12,650 for a new engine",

A catastrophic failure like this can cause tons of other damage along the way, so unless we are able to see the underside of the rest of the car it's hard to say how bad things are. But, assuming it broke \"cleanly\" and didn't damage anything else along the way, replacing a CV axel isn't the worst thing. Assuming no other damage, parts, you're looking at 500-800ish dollars, plus 3ish hours of labour, so let's say about $1000-$1200 plus taxes, assuming you go for good OEM parts. Cheaper OE equivalent parts will probably be dramatically cheaper. Again though, assuming nothing else was damaged. If other things were damaged, the cost could easily double or more.",

I have a kia ceed crdi 1.6 hatchback and love it, and while it's not my first car it has all the luxury comforts you need while being very safe, very affordable its under your budget of 10k infact, and parts are massively readily available everywhere, it's also very easy to work on yourself to save money doing your own servicing. I'd really recommend the kia ceed crdi or even the pro ceed if you want more power and flashy trim, mine is the 115hp edition but there are more powerful models. you can buy a gps unit like a tomtom or get a phone mount to use your phone for satnav, it has bluetooth for music/audio. rear boot has a compartment under the boot(trunk) for your spare donut wheel with a jack so you can replace a flat on the side of the road fast, the boot is very spacious, enough for all your shopping, its not a little lunchbox like some hatchbacks. backup camera isn't an option with this car model year but you can fit your own very easily, the dashcam i bought has a wire for using it as a backup camera which i didnt wire in as i prefer to use my mirrors and not be lazy and get complacent using technology that can fail due to bad weather ie your camera maybe dirty or be dowsed in heavy rain and you wont be able to see anything. limiting yourself to toyota or honda is gonna hurt especially if you want fully fleshed out modern 2020+ features for 10k or less, older cars have everything but some of these features like built in nav units which are pretty bad anyway, i much prefer using a tomtom or my phone as i can mount it in a better place that is easier to glance at while driving instead of having to take my eyes fully off the road.",

I know its production was short so not many people have bought this, not even mentioning building one. Any suggestions on where and if I can find or match better looking exterior parts? It's obviously not like finding a rocketbunny pack for a bmw but I need to at least know I've tried. For the interior: a multi steering wheel, short shifter, better seats, sound system. The d4d Toyota engine I've heard is a good base to start a build but not sure if this was just about their 1.8l. Will the smaller engine feel any different?",

        "body": "The idea of a project car is a banger or something that is in shit shape and you invest time and money to fix it. You've bought a very uncommon car so you may struggle to get aftermarket bits for it. My 1995 peugeot 205 1.6ltr had a 88hp engine, it was a very popular car (the GTi version was the hot hatch of the 80s and early 90s and was famous with boy racers) and so because of the GTi there were a lot of modded aftermarket parts available for the entire range of peugeot 205s. You've essentially went and bought something that not many if any boy racer wants, not many if any aftermarket producers will make parts for it as it's not an ideal model, there is no performance model in that range. My 205 topped out at 95mph stock, you've got a much more modern car that is worse in comparison. A steering wheel is simple to replace, you'll lose any functionality of buttons installed on the wheel if you want a boy racers wheel, short shifters can be modified with brackets and what not if you know an engineer and want to butcher a decent short shifter like what a lot of BMW owners install in their 5 and 6 speed manuals, seats are easy to replace and again if you want recaro buckets you'll lose all the functionality of modern comforts ie height and lumbar adjustment and heating capacity - you can easily modify a seat for heating if you have the know how, and sound systems are the easiest things to upgrade, if you have front and rear speakers they are behind grills, pop the grill or door card off to find the speaker and get the dimensions, or use google to find you a parts site ie ebay that you can enter your car details to find ideal replacements by pioneer/apine etc, same goes for main pillar tweeters, you can always go the boy racer route of wiring in your own massive speakers and sub plus amp in the rear on the parcel shelf/boot with underseat amp, wiring extra speakers in is quite easy, you jsut need to pop the radio out and rip up all the carpet/flooring and possibly remove your entire central console to access it and make wires tidy. bigger engines pump more oxygen, bigger engines are always more exciting. in my 205 i had a 1.6ltr, the biggest was a 1.9ltr and the smallest was a 1.0ltr, the GTi came in 1.6 and 1.9 variants with the 1.6 being more common as a base to use with engine swaps with the MI16 16v 2ltr engine from the peugeot 405, the 1.9L had bigger wheels and better brakes with a better turbo so people of different \"calibers\" of modification went with either car, more 1.6s had engine swaps and hot tunes for track use, more 1.9s had turbo and super charger combinations for insane power output which was more common for showing off at shows. you can always bore up a smaller engine to get more out of it, there is a limit to how much you can bore them out as you're removing extra material which puts the block under higher strain, doing engine mods requires a lot of research as you've probably seen plenty of vids of someone putting say a massive garett turbo in their car and slamming it with wider wheels and when they floor it after showing off trying to do a burnout they destroy something or the engine blows, because they neglected to upgrade a lot of other things. you need to do your research, maybe there is a hidden community for this car, but your easiest ways to get more go power out of it are to get it remapped with a stage 1-3 tune, port your intake valves, upgrade your air intake, fit bigger injectors as more fuel in the combustion = more go go power instantly, look for a better exhaust system that is wider bore with less restriction and dont neglect your exhaust manifold, if you dont have a turbo fitting a turbo is a lot of free power but you will always get more power out of even a stock engine by getting more aggressive cam shafts, you'll need to get it remapped to see the most benefit especially when fucking with the intake/exhaust and if fitting a turbo or super, not getting a remap is how you lose power and effeciency.",

It usually happens when accelerating at about 1500RPM. If I go over 2k rpm the sound goes away. The sounds also happens when coming almost to a full stop. In 1st gear it’s not really noticeable. It’s more in 2nd and 3rd gear that you can hear it. It’s coming from the front right corner, somewhere near the passenger seats. I tried rolling down my windows but the you can’t hear nothing. I think it might be the water pump or some pulleys. I’m sure that’s it’s nothing related to the Transmission or the suspension because when just cruising and not stepping on the gas the noise is gone. And also when in park there is no sound. I checked the heat shields on the exhaust. I have no exhaust leaks, no coolant leaks. Car has only 80k km. What are your thoughts on that? Any idea?",

To access it, you’ll need to remove the driver’s side kick panel and locate the secondary fuse board behind the OBD2 port. If the fuse appears intact, try swapping it with Fuse #32, which controls the rear defrost, as they share the same amperage rating. In some cases, the fog light circuit is also linked to the windshield wiper relay, so if your wipers are working intermittently, replacing Relay K5 in the engine bay fuse box may resolve the issue.",

I have 2 quotes around $5000-$5500 I own the car, clean title, no payment, no nothing. The junk yard offered $1700 but I think if I replace the transmission I could turn around and sell the car for around $8,000. Would that be a foolish thing? I already bought a new car and the only dealership willing to give me anything was a Nissan dealer but none of their vehicles excite me and after having one with less than 80k on the clock die like that doesn't give me much confidence in the brand as a whole. Long story short, sell to junk yard for $1500-$1700 or replace transmission and turn around and resell for $7500-$8500 It would be nice to see a car in that good of shape get on the road again vs getting picked apart in a yard.",

        "body": "Generally, ANY damage to a sidewall means you should replace the tire as the sidewall is the most fragile, thin and easily compromised part of the tire. That being said: In your case, as with many low profile, performance tires, they typically have extra rubber near the bead, right along the rim, to protect the rim from curb damage. The rubber along the sidewall here is quite thick, easily several times as thick as other parts of the sidewall. In your case, so long as it isn't too deep, then you'll be fine, and it's just cosmetic. If this WASN'T a low profile tire with a rim protector, and was any other normal tire, any damage like this to the sidewall should be treated as if a blow-out could happen at any moment, and the tire should be immediately replaced. So I guess you're a bit lucky though it probably doesn't feel that way… Having been there myself, I empathize. Might be worth while checking to see if your rims are still in round after a hit like that though. Mine sure as shit weren't. 😅😭",

If you have a petrol/gasoline engine your sparkplugs and the distributor should be checked, as a bad distributor or poor connection to sparkplugs will see no more spark so no combustion, if you aren't hearing a poorly running engine it wont be individual sparkplug issue and more likely the distributor could be faulty. check your fuse box and every fuse in it to see if they are blown. if \"someone else checked your battery\" do yourself a solid and check it yourself, i call this process Trust but Verify. it's to make sure they have actually bothered to check it, and knowing yourself is knowledge & something to cross off the list.",

It looks like they just added a mailing address. This can’t be right, and they messed something up? I can’t imagine I can sell this car if I’m not listed at the owner. Please advise. TIA!",

If you're the Executor normally it's your job to \"keep it safe\" before probate and I was therefor required to keep it insured and not put a ton of miles on it (and had to drive it a bit to keep it running), but \"the Estate\" was still the owner and paid for the insurance until I got probate and could distribute the Estate. I kept the car as part of my share of the Estate so I had to take the certified probated Will in once I could distribute the Estate in order to get a refund for the Estate for the unused insurance and to register it in my name and insure it. If I wasn't keeping the car I could have sold it as the Executor the minute I got probate and I assume I would have had to still show them the probated Will in order to cancel the registration and insurance if I sold it to someone else. Hopefully you can apply that information to your situation. Sorry for your loss.",

The first copy they didn’t even send to the right address, they mailed it to his old address. And I had to go back to the RMV and ask where it was because it never arrived. And they realized it was sent to his old apartment and then the one I received finally only had my name and address for the mailing address. I’m just…. So frustrated with them.

The “Toyota tax” is steep but the reliability comparison between a Jeep patriot and a RAV4 is no comparison. In that budget you may have better luck looking at Mazda. While not as reliable as Toyota in my experience, the discrepancy is not as extreme as Toyota/Jeep. If both vehicles are up to date with their service history, I would personally side with the RAV4. I encourage you to look at CX-5’s as well. If you can find a significantly newer and lower mileage one, I’d probably go that route over the RAV4 personally.",

After a day of trying to figure out what's going on here and watching YouTube videos that seemingly show a slightly different build on the system I'm at a loss. The system I see in most diagrams and the videos show a resonator tube going into the muffler then out through a good length of pipe to the tailpipe. However mine seemingly has a resonator tube, middle, second resonator then the tail pipe. Going into the second resonator/(muffler?) is where it is rusted. I purchased a section of pipe and new tail pipe and am debating just attaching it to the other side of the muffler and bypassing the whole back end of the system. Not sure if this will work, if the second muffler/resonator is necessary? Or if perhaps it was a system for the V8 model that was swapped onto here at some point. I've attached a diagram of what I'm currently looking at for context, would this work okay?",

One day, pretty cold out, the radio randomly turned on the next time we turned it on, about 2-3 hours later id say, it didn’t turn back on again. This is probably the 2nd-3rd head unit on it and i am just confused on why it’s doing this. I have already checked the fuse and the wires it is neither, im just confused how it turned on one time and then stopped working again.",

    "selftext": "I’m hoping some people will give me advice on what to do regarding which car to sell, and which to keep. A while ago, I was given a 2013 CRV, and have been loving it so far. It has about 115,000 miles on it. It’s not the fanciest or the strongest car, but it gets the job done and has great gas mileage. Just recently, my grandfather gave me his old vehicle, which is a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee, and it is upgraded with all the bells and whistles. This is by far the fanciest car I could ever see myself owning. The bonus is that this car only has 51,000 miles on it! This car is a beast, which I like, but it comes with a cost. It gets about half the mileage of the CRV. Insurance to keep one over the other is negligible. The cost to keep both is surprisingly affordable, but I don’t have the need for both cars. My CRV has a Kelly blue book of about $7k-11k, the Jeep has a value of $5k-9k. I recognize the Jeep has wayyyy less miles, but it is also a Jeep and I have had terrible experiences with them needing lots of repairs… What would you do? Keep both? Sell one, and if so what one?",

At the same time, the mileage on the more reliable CR-V is double of the Jeep and at certain point things that are more expensive would need to be replaced on it as well. Last point is that the Jeep should have some nostalgic value since its been your grandads' car.

Even if it doesn’t, you can use it in a pinch but I wouldn’t stray too far from the manufacturer’s recommendations on a routine basis lest you cause major engine damage due to pinging and predetonation. Premium won’t give you any more fuel economy or more than a couple hp more than basic 87. There’s the same amount of heat energy in all gasoline grades, but the higher octane will keep it from igniting before the spark plug fires under the increased cylinder pressure of a turbocharged engine. Premium fuel is harder to ignite, which also gives you a slightly slower explosion of power against the piston which is why you might see 3-5hp more on the engine dyno with high octane fuel. What WILL make a difference is good quality gasoline. Avoid the no-name convenience store gas. The gasoline stock is all the same coming from the local refinery, but the Big Gas crowd (Shell, BP, Exxon, etc) adds proprietary additives and detergents to their blends to maintain fuel injectors and clean out build ups inside the fuel injectors. In fact, an old mechanics trick for a car running mediocre to rough is to fill it up a couple times with Shell premium (has more of the additives) and take the car for a 4-6 hours road trip. Will likely run like a top afterwards. It’s definitely worth the extra 5-6 cents per gallon to fuel at a big name gas station versus the local convenience store but don’t sweat it if you have to use the other gas occasionally.",

Putting lower than required octane in the vehicle will, best case, cause it to try to compensate which will result in reduced power and reduced gas mileage which will end up costing you more money anyway. Just as a reference point, in Ford's 2.3 turbo, putting 87 in instead of 91 results in a 10% less in power and a 10-15% drop in mpg. And that's with a turbo engine Fird designed to work on 87. Worst case scenaio you put the engine in an early costing you a LOT more money than putting the right gas in. Even if you have a non turbo Subaru (do they make these?) If they are requiring 91 octane it's because the engine is a high compression/performance naturally aspirated engine on which the above still applies (though the effects will be smaller).",

The purpose of the oxygen sensor is to control the ratio of fuel to air that gets injected into your engine. Getting the right ratio makes sure your engine runs efficiently and properly. A malfunctioning oxygen sensor can do anything from have no effect, to totally destroy your engine. Though those two extremes are both unlikely, often times you'll see your fuel economy will be worse, and you might risk damaging your catalytic converter. That being said, it sounds like have a P0132 O2 Sensor Circuit High, which can often be because the heater circuit is shorted to the sensor circuit. Assuming the damage is in the sensor itself, it could be as simple as replacing the sensor. However it could also be a wiring problem somewhere in the car, or a computer issue. These are far harder to diagnose and require testing each component in the chain, step by step. So, can you leave it? Maybe… I don't really know and it's hard to say without diagnosing it properly… but the sensors are usually only a couple hundred dollars, and at the going diagnosis rate now a days, it's probably better to just get it diagnosed and replaced, instead of waiting for later, but that's up to you.",

I settled on a solid price for a 2025 Nissan Sentra but when we were signing paperwork the finance guy asked if I was willing to add extended warranty. He pretty much said he usually gives it for 4k but will give to me for 2,600 if I recall correctly. Here’s the thing he made it seem like I’m paying for 6 years of warranty on my car but I realized I’m only paying for an extra year which is absurd. I was just gonna call it a loss till I found out recently it’s possible to cancel extended warranty. The car was new with less than 30 miles. I signed the paperwork 3 months ago so I was curious if it’s possible to get a refund for extended warranty. If so how would I go about doing it. Any help is much appreciated thanks in advance.",

They’re all amazing cars in terms of performance but keep in mind. These cars do have a lot of maintenance you’ll need to keep up with. If you end up getting a European car please follow the owners manual to a T! No missing any oil changes. In fact if the book says every 5k miles. Do an oil change at 3k. BMW is known for leaking oil. My friend has that Audi too and his engine also started to leak. But if you can fork up the $ every month to maintain it and you try not abuse the car then it should be ok. If the BMW. Check and see if behind the middle seat in the back passenger seat that folds down will let you into the trunk because my friends had a metal plate that didn’t allow you to into the trunk from the inside of the car so if the battery dies you’re not getting into the trunk to do any battery work. You’ll have to tear apart the trunk lights from the outside to get into it too. The battery also needs to be recoded too so it’s going to be a very expensive fix + towing if your insurance won’t cover it the tow fee. Honestly. If want the experience of a BMW but reliability of a Toyota you can go for the GR Supra. The company’s worked their ass off to make an amazing car with performance and reliability. As an adult now. As much fun these kinds of cars are. You’ll start to appreciate saving money. Get one of these kinds of cars later in life and go for a Honda civic or Toyota Camry or Corolla. Save your money and get these later. Your insurance is also going to be high since you’re young and don’t have driving years on your record.",

Oz is more inline with the US, so cars are kept longer and there arent as many, of the cars worth importing anyway. Australia has great cars, and the few that have made it, albeit in disguise, were quite popular. the holden monaro (pontiac gto) and the holden commodore (chevy ss and pontiac g8) are cult-classics, for those in the know. before the recession of '08, we were going to get a pontiac g8 ute (think el camino) based on the commodore ute, but pontiac was binned. and thats just the holden/chevy side. ford has *amazing* cars that live in the Oz ecosystem. mad max's trademark car is a ford falcon xb. the barra boosted sixes are underappreciated legends in their own right. i think if more people were aware of aussie cars and the importing process was more transparent and established, we'd have more aussie cars on murican roads.",

That, and the Aussie steering wheel is of course on the right, which is a nonstarter for most ppl...Luckily, the gas and brake pedals are the same as here. Me, I couldn't: I'd accidentally drive on the left for sure, I actually made that mistake in my car after moving back several times and am super lucky that it didn't end badly!!!! I honestly can't think of a single car from there that I'd ever want to see here (especially thinking of the Utes- it's like AUS must've fallen in love with our oldschool Camino models and decided to turn otherwise cute sporty cars into ugly things that are pickup trucks in the back🤢🤮 I noticed most there didnt even drive Aussie cars there (smart to stick w Toyota and Honda just like here) and most people where I lived drove 5-15 yr old cars (bc they're way more expensive to buy there so it's easier to hold on to what you have) The non-Aussie models there were amazing to see, however (especially bc we never see them here- I loved Alfa Romeo cars and there many other makes and models that I'd never seen here but were beautiful (my memory's blank on what they were though!!!!!!). I did love that most people drive smaller vehicles (in cities/suburbs at least), it makes me sad that I can't be safe in a small car here anymore... But I can't imagine it EVER being worthwhile to have ANY car shipped here from 10,000 miles away (unless you love it THAT much, in which case it would be!). If you're talking about foreign models sold there, maybe see if they can be shipped from THAT country instead (if we don't have tariffs that makes it impossible, which IS the case for SO MANY amazing vehicles, especially the affordable ones that can't be sold here bc USA can't compete with foreign quality and affordable prices).

    "selftext": "For a little more than three years, I've been driving my mom's old 2016 Hyundai Elantra. Aside from some tire and turn signal issues, it ran well for a long time. Then back in December, the check engine light comes on solid and there's a slight acceleration lag. At this point it had been over a year since my last oil change, largely due to a demanding work schedule (two jobs, one of which requires a car). After a quick oil change at Jiffy Lube fails to correct the problem, I take it to my main mechanic, who is able to fix it within a day and cites an oil filter issue as the cause. After this, it runs solidly again for a month, but then out of nowhere I'm driving home from work and the car suddenly drops in speed and the check engine light starts flashing. I take it back to my main mechanic. After two days he cites bad gasoline and a low gas level as the problem. He recommends I fill it wish Shell Premium. For the first day it runs fine, but the following day a rattle starts coming from the engine and once again the flashing check engine light. The mechanic takes another look and confirms a damaged rod. By this point the car only has 90,000 some miles on it and is less than ten years old, putting it well within the warranty. But I've heard that the fact I went so long without an oil change may void that warranty, even though I did have that taken care of at the first sign of trouble, the car operated fine for a little bit afterwards, and my mechanic had initially diagnosed the problems as something else entirely. What are the chances my warranty is voided?",

Even if the wipers are turned off or turned on a higher speed they stay the same speed that the automatic wiper stetting is on. If i reverse then the rear wipers also start wiping. After they wipe for a time they suddenly stop and i get a notification that my wipers have a problem. Then after a minute or so they start randomly wiping again. They are turned off during this and still keep wiping. I’m sure it has to do something with the sensors for automatic wiping but i don’t really know. I’ve sent it to Mercedes and they replaced the sensor for the wipers but it didn’t help. Thanks",

If you spend more then 35% on housing, you'd be house poor!

Now, buying a 2k, paid in cash, shitmobile, learning to fix it yourself, taking it to the local highschool shops class for repairs, used parts from a junk yard etc., you may be able to make it work for under $225/month, but it would be tight. A few things: -you're 18, working pt- you will be making more money down the road. -you could buy the 2k car, walk to work sometimes, drive minimally, and make it work. -because your part time and young, if you find yourself needing more money, just amp up the working hours and avoid debt. Transmission blow? Park the car, get a bus pass and work like a motherfucker until you have the cash to fix it. When I was 18 and needed money, I worked 80+/hr week then turned down the work intensity dial when appropriate.

(sorry for the long explanation) now, for some numbers: let’s say you buy a vehicle for $2,000. you take it to a shop, get it inspected, it may need another 1-2000 for repairs and maintenance up keep, or less if you are mechanically inclined. we’ll just say another $1000 for the sake of the example. you have $200 for registration and we’ll say $400 a month for insurance (numbers might be high, but it’s all for example). so, for a vehicle that was listed for 2 grand, you’ve now spent $3600 just to get it in a good condition to your liking and legal to drive on the road. so lets go someplace. well, we need gas. let’s say it costs $50 to fill up the tank, and we’ll say you fill up twice a month. that’s $100 a month, along with the 400 for insurance: $500 a month for the vehicle. full coverage, high deductible is cheaper for you per month, but if something serious happens, your wallet will be crying. a lower deductible will not be as nice to pay per month, but if something serious happens, you’ll be much better off. you get into a crash, regardless of what happens, you’ll have to pay that deductible for repair. now if you have liability, and you get into a crash, and YOU’RE at fault… gg bro. in any case, these are the numbers you’ll have to keep in mind. you can do insurance shopping, with the VIN number, you can get quite an accurate number, and that’ll be the biggest deciding factor as to whether or not you’d be able to afford a car. and by all means, if you are going to be left with a small financial cushion after this purchase, DO NOT BUY THE CAR. save a bit more and wait. you do not want to put yourself in a situation where your hands are tied behind your back. if you have any other questions, i’d be happy to answer",

I took my car (2012 Volkswagen Jetta, 83,000 miles) in for an oil change and had them look to see if there was anything that needed to be fixed and there’s quite a bit. They couldn’t give me a clear quote because they said I needed to pay for a diagnostic, but it would start at 1,200 and go up from there. Here are the things wrong with my car that I found out today. Major things: - Under car fluid leaks - Bad battery (I personally think there’s a connection problem because I buy batteries frequently) - Check engine light (have to pay more to find out what’s wrong with that) - Diesel filter clogged - Contaminated coolant - Bad engine air filter - Brake Fluid -Other diagnostic codes present Things I could probably fix on my own: - Wipers - Missing lug nut - Daytime running light The car itself isn’t even probably worth what I would pay to get it fixed, but it’s so low mileage for a used car that I’m not sure if I could find anything remotely close to it. It’s also paid off. Personally, would you get it fixed or scrap it?",

Also you can definitely fix the engine air filter and battery on you're own, it's as simple as swapping it in and out. The coolant is also not that hard, about as hard as an oil change. and you're oil filter should be changed every oil change anyways (also not that hard). Not sure if your health permits it but I would learn to do those things and just keep the car running until it quits.",

        "body": "I would keep it, though I know how to replace, or look into most of these concerns. The leak, contaminated coolant, and the check engine light are the only serious concerns, the rest is just maintenance. If you are able to put the car on ramps or Jack stands you can check the underside to see how bad the leak is, if it’s just seepage I wouldn’t worry about it just check every now and then. If it is literally dripping fluid and there’s a lot then get it diagnosed. Check engine light is easy to check at a place like autozone or if you have your own scanner. There’s a couple catered to VWs like OBDeleven and VAGcom. You can take the code and google it to see what is up, could be a very easy fix or not. The coolant issue might be them trying to sell you a coolant flush, if so not a huge deal. If it is actually contaminated with oil then that is a bigger issue. Diesel filter is mostly pretty easy to replace on this car. I had a Golf TDI and it was easy, you might have to move a couple things out of the way and clamp and remove some hoses, but check out a YouTube video to see if you’re up to it. It’s something you can do on the side of the road, the car doesn’t need to be lifted in the air. It is an important maintenance item though definitely get it done. Air filter is extremely easy to do yourself but you’ll need to buy a torx set. They’re cheap at harbor freight and are very handy to have for Volkswagens. They’re basically like screwdrivers with a star shape instead of a + or - shape. Brake fluid is kind of a whatever thing, I’d do it myself but it’s a bit more involved than the rest and it’s expensive at the dealership. If I wasn’t doing it myself I’d honestly probably just skip that. I’ve seen cars come into the shop with 100k+ miles and never flushed their fluid and the car brakes like normal. In short, don’t sell it. Go on YouTube and see if you feel capable of doing some of these things yourself. If not, sell it to me lol",

Is using the paddles during automatic different from moving the knob to the left and going into manual mode? If so, does going into manual mode prevent the use of paddles from going back to auto, assuming the paddles take place of actually moving the shifter? I guess in LCI cars, you can’t even move the shifter, so you have to use the paddles, making me think it is the same though? So, moving the shift knob over to the left (M) in pre-LCI (or i guess down to S in LCI cars) would that put you in a “full” manual state? - If I’m wrong about that, how does the LCI cars shifter work? It looks weird and I’m curious. How does they switch to manual mode? Is it just initiating the shifters? Going to S at the bottom or is that the same as just clicking sport mode on the button? I personally have pre-LCI, but now I’m also curious if that S at the bottom in the LCI car shifter is just another sport mode or if that’s their version of moving the shifter to the left for “manual mode”. Also, does foot need to ever come off gas? Anyways, I have no idea id this made sense and also if there’s any logistics I missed about shifting, manual, paddles, etc. please include. Also, any other tips/tricks to do with the paddles, shifting, anything unique to BMW, and also just tips on when to up/downshift. Anything, I’m all ears and excited to learn. I’m new to BMW and want to make the most of it! Thanks!",

Now, it's my first car as I only used a bike, but I know how to work on it, because I worked as a mechanic for a few years and my dad is currently one, and the fact that is old is make it easier to repair it or mod it, mostly for fuel efficiency. The only thing that scare me is the mileage because it use petrol and it's a 2400cc and online I found contrasting opinion, from 6l/km (39.2Mpg) to some 14l/km (16Mpg) so to be honest it scares me a bit because I don't have a crazy salary and I don't want to spend it all in gas 🥲 So, is there someone that have the car or know someone who does that can help me ?

I played too much for it and didn't inspect it well enough I'm pretty embarrassed about driving the new (older) corolla I got. I though the problems it did have could fix it cheap but there is the start of paint fade that needs to be resprayed, hard to see in photo. The door pillars are damaged, don't mind the scratches as on a good week im travelling 600km on the highway and it's already sustained more. Had to do $400 in parts of repairs and that's me doing everything myself. (Was a ex Toyota tech) How do I feel less embarrassed about the corolla? Any kind words would be appreciated. I'm half tempted to accept the loss and look for another car but that would affect my cash cushion or drive it to the ground. Thanks reddit",

Every scratch and dent is just part of the car’s story, and now it’s part of yours too. Plus, having a cash cushion gives you peace of mind, which is way more valuable than a shiny paint job.

There are several different sunroof suppliers and designs out there, and many manufacturers will actually contract out a few different manufacturers, even in the same vehicle. For example, in the Volkswagen A4 platform, there were 2 or 3 different manufacturers that supplied VW with sunroofs, as I recall. All functioned similarly, but had different functional designs for their mechanics. All that being said, with regards to the sunroof cover (to which I assume you mean the shade that covers the glass), they typically either slide back into a gap between the headliner and the roof, or some are simply a roll of fabric that's pulled taught, and simply unrolls when you close the shade, and rolls back up when you open the shade. If there's a specific make and model of vehicle in mind, you can post it here, and we can see if we can find a more specific answer for that particular unit.",

In that range the car shudders quite aggressively, it almost feels like the enjoying is hesitating. It’s not really a vibration just a back and forth shaking. I’ve heard that this is a fairly common issue with CRVs and some outside research brought me to the conclusion that I need to change the transmission fluid. Just here looking to see if anyone has had a similar issue and how they were able to fix it. Thank you so much!",

To start I’m looking for more internal upgrades like coil packs, spark plugs, sway bars maybe sky’s the limit. But also minor stuff like tints and new headlights; I have car heads in my family but I’m new to it as far as seriously upgrading a vehicle I own. I also see budget asked about in posts like this; for me I want the whole car to work properly first, so QoL purchases get made first (new brake line, new starter). But after that, I’m what I’ll consider semi-flexible so maybe 3-4 car parts a month*. Eventually I want to slam it on some coil-overs but that is, in my mind, one of the last mods I do which is far far away. But for now, I want to learn and I want to grow.

There isn’t much more you can do unless you are comfortable tracing the charge control wires to see if they are damaged, sorry I can’t help you more, YouTube is a great resource also but make sure to watch multiple videos on whatever your trying to figure out so you don’t end up following the advice of one dummy.",

You see it all the time in the 4x4 community where people get absolutely reamed for mods that don't need and don't use. Keep in mind the idea of engineering compromise, every positive comes with a negative. Lower the vehicle? It will handle better because it has a lower centre of gravity. But you will feel every bump on the road. Lift a vehicle? Better ground clearance for obstacles, but you raise your centre of gravity, making rolling over more likely, and negatively affect the handling. Tune for more power, will also increase fuel usage and effect reliability. Even adding a subwoofer in the rear means you'll basically rule your car out for roadtrips with family/friends because you won't be able to take much stuff in your boot. So yeah, make a list on your phone of mod ideas, and weigh up the pros/cons of each. Especially if it's something expensive and/or can't be easily undone.",

There is a large hole in the oil pan and all the oil leaked out of the car and the coolant leaked out of the radiator. The car was driven about 1/4 of a mile after the incident and was leaking oil and coolant until it was parked. The car continued to run until it was parked and turned off. The rest of the oil and coolant leaked out of the car and it would not start the next morning. The oil and check engine light is on and there is no visible damage to the engine itself, only the undercarriage. I am wondering if I should keep the car and show photos of it to some mechanics and see how much it would cost to repair or if I should scrap the car and sell it for $300-$700 for salvage. https://imgur.com/gallery/nZwBSoV",

I called a couple other mechanics for their opinions and one said it was very important I get that fixed and make sure it's done correctly or it could tear up my transmission.

There is not many in my country and i didn't really give to much importance about it's past history, so i dont know anything about its past maintenance. The car hasn't had any problems since i bought it. I know that without pictures its hard to say but is there anything I should prioritise? The only thing i notice is when starting the engine after a few hours if i lift the clutch to rapidly it seems like it almost goes down, but if i press again there is no problem, so i dont give much importance.

It's not a great car for us as we live on a hill in a wintery place, so AWD and more clearance would be ideal, so I'm inclined to sell it within the year. In addition to regular fluids, pads, and tire replacements, here's the list of repairs over the last couple of years: * replaced ignition and key 500 * replaced right front strut (it was broken) and rear shock absorbers 700 * repaired and recharged air conditioning system 500 * replaced wheel bearing 500 * replaced battery 100 * replaced headlight assemblies 300 * Adjusted valve clearance 400 Here's what needs fixing (mostly wear cycle stuff) with approximate price tag: * replace AC condenser - $800 * manual transmission - still shifts but its getting rocky - $2000 * rear spring - rides low in the back, bottoms out - $500 * the other front strut - way past its 100k mile lifespan - $300 * replace windshield with 3\" crack - $400 to replace * should also note the paint is subject to the [notorious honda paint defect](https://www.8thcivic.com/threads/finally-paint-warranty-extention-questions-answered-tsb-14-034.493217/), though of course that's aesthetic So, having spent $3k, do we spend $4k to do all the repairs before we sell it, or let someone else have the headache/joy of car repair?",

Day of; I had just reached the left turn lane, saw a green arrow following behind a larger vehicle. I looked & did not see anyone directly coming. Upon turning I was hit, completely shocked by what happened. (The vehicle in front of me turning was just missed)😱 Seemed as tho the car I was hit by, was speeding. Didn’t even try to avoid it by using breaks to slow down, believe the speed limit around there is 25, they were going faster than that. I got hit on the right passenger side, but in the front. Hood Smashed in. I had a smaller car as they had a bigger kind with a bike rack. My car totaled. Due to not receiving an insurance card in the mail, I called my car insurance for them to inform me my vehicle was not on the policy, but my old car I sold in 2023 was still active. (I have proof of me transferring the title over) Being confused on why; I must have called a different company instead, when I bought the car to try to switch over the vehicle back in 2023. Since i had been on my grandpa’s plan previous with the first car (the one on the policy apparently) - switched it to my own - sold it in 2023 - bought the new car which had also been on my grandpa’s policy - thinking I switched over insurance to this current one. Ive been trying to get help to be covered for the accident, but am having trouble doing so. I get brushed off, each person referring me to someone else to make the change. No one able to do so. Who can I talk to that would. Ive been paying them high rates for a long time now. As well as a ticket has been issued since “no active insurance” I don’t want to have to pay it while I have be paying on a vehicle no longer owned",

    "selftext": "The car: 2008 Kia Sorento EX with 4x4 and the 3.7L V6 engine and a little over 300,000 miles. The question: With this list of issues would it better to get rid of the car or to fix it? Also, any ideas on what to replace or fix or what to tell an auto repair shop would be appreciated! Issue #1: I was told the rear end needed welding when I bought the car. My husband said he could do it but then decided he didn't want to try and risk messing it up which I respect but wish he'd said that sooner. I'm not sure what parts are involved he just keeps saying the rear end. I know there is a hollow tube that's broke in half that hangs down right beside the passenger rear tire. He now says that after looking at the rear end and doing some research the rear end can be replaced. I have called a lot of mechanics shops but nobody will work on the rear end so I'll have to trust my husband to do that job apparently, if I can find the part. Issue #2: I had it about a month and the check engine light started to come on occasionally. Maybe 1-2 monthly and would go off on its own after some time. Always the code is P0430- Catalyst system efficiency below threshold bank 2. Issue #3: About 3 days ago I was driving, very cold single digits temperature but I let it warm up for about 20min and temp gauge was on the quarter mark, speed was below 40mph. There was a hard jerk feeling and it started to shake really hard and got louder. Very little power going up hill. Check engine light came on but wasn't already on, Codes were - P0300 (random/multiple cylinder misfire detected)(this one twice), P0016 (crankshaft position camshaft position correlation bank 1 sensor a), P0303 (cylinder 3 misfire detected), P0305 (cylinder 5 misfire detected), and of course P0430- Catalyst system efficiency below threshold bank 2. I have $900 in the bank. I'm trying to figure out if it's worth it to try and fix this car or if I would be better off looking for something else with different problems. Thank you for your time and kindness.",

The fact it's only causing misfire in one side of the engine and not the other suggests it's not oil pressure related. So you're either looking at a bad camshaft or crankshaft position sensor (crankshaft would be my guess) or an actual issue with the timing chain or belt (not sure which yours has. My wife has a 2014 soul and it has a chain) or you have a worn tensioner pulley. If it has a timing chain, that *shouldn't* be the issue, and it's probably the tensioner if it has oil and the sensors are good. Now, the cat code is most likely your downstream O2 sensor. It could be the cat since the car has 300k miles, but if it is, then you have another issue unrelated to the other stuff (ok possibly related but not the cause of the cat failure). Catalytic converters don't just fail. Something caused it to fail. If it's low oil and a faulty O2 sensor, you're looking at $40. In the other end, if it's a damaged timing chain/ belt or tensioner and a failed cat, you looking at north of $2k. The other combinations will fall somewhere in between.",

Sometimes I hold the key in start, sometimes I'll let it spring back to the accessory position, sometimes I'll cycle it a bunch of times back to back and the engine will eventually start.

Its fender caddling and fender were always a little off-center, but I never thought too much of it. Fast forward, I'm on a road trip, and the caddling flies off and takes my side marker and its wiring. I take a look to see what is left to order parts and find the weirdest wiring situation. Seems the previous owners did something here. Now I'm having a hard time figuring out what's what and how to rewire this. Plus, I don't know if it's related, but not too long after, my headlight starts acting up. High beams work and not low beams. I replaced the bulbs and the switch and checked the fuses and the relay but had no luck. I'm wondering if it's a larger wiring problem, and if so, is this something I can figure out on my own, or would I need to take it in?",

    "selftext": "My ford explorer keeps having so many issues. The current codes that are coming up: * P0430: Catalyst System Efficiency below threshold Bank 2 * c1137-64: reverse gear switch - signal plausibility failure * u3003-16: batter voltage - circuit voltage below threshold (just for a new battery last year) * U0401-68: invalid data received from (ecm)(pcm) What we have fixed so far to it: * New battery last year. * New catalyst converter, just the front one. we had someone read the computer bit further and their thing said the 02 sensors were working fine and that it was the front converter. So we replaced that but engine light is still on. I used to have a weird battery issue where it kept dying and would leak battery fluid. did that on two separate batteries. Got new connector piece, and it finally stopped doing that. But still showing I have battery that isnt at the right voltage? My backup camera rarely works, sometimes it will flash on and off or someimtes it works, but the majority of the time it just says \"contact dealership\" My car will also randomly turn the music back on when it is not started or anything. I will lock up and walk away and then the music will turn on. All of this, I believe I have some wiring issues somewhere causing all these weird things? Does anyone have any knowledge/experience of this happening to them and how they fixed it? We have already put a few thousand dollars into this car over the last two years and want to try to continue to fix it, we just cant fathom a car payment for a new car! We are able to do the work ourselves for the most part, but we are feeling stuck on solutions. Any ideas appreciated.",

There are a few ways to do this, some more safe than others. If you have a scan tool you can look to see if the fuel trims are rich. That would indicate a lean condition caused by unmeasured air from a vacuum leak. While you're there, check the intake air temp sensor, coolant sensor and any other temperature sensor to see if their values actually make sense AND update as the conditions change like they should.",

The thing is I'm planning on getting a new car soon at some point this year. I'm open to either selling this Honda or trading it in to get some value for the new car. My question is am I better off not repairing the car locks and letting the car go as is when I go to sell or trade? So I could save myself some money I would have spent on repair.

TLDR, you gotta figure out if the diffs lock or not when in 4x4, if not then your fine to run it all the time if you’re ok with the increased wear on the front axles/diff and extra fuel consumption/ tire wear.",

Now that everything is back together and there's a new battery installed we are having a problem repeatedly. BMS is reset. PCM is reset. We start the vehicle and it starts ok but the dash instruments are illuminated but don't seem to have power to them to give readings. If the car is then turned off and we try to re-start it, we DO see power to the gauges with readings but the engine cranks and doesn't ever turn over. This then repeats until the PCM is reset again and then the issue reoccurs in exactly the same order. Any ideas??",

Has all seasons on it now and they said they won’t put winters on it but can give me a discount with their affiliate tire shop in town. Comes with a 6 month warranty on it. Price will be 14,900$ CAD all taxes and fees in and registration done there so I pay and drive away. Not very experienced in this area as I’ve only bought one car and it was from a trusted family friend for a very good price so I’m just weary of spending this much money. I’ve been having a terrible time finding a decent one from a private sale so I have now gone the used dealer route.

        "body": "Definitely not enough information to diagnose why it won't start definitively. If no lights on dash and no dome light, check for blown main fuse. It's a big fuse, usually over 100 amps. YouTube your vehicle year make and model + \"main fuse location\" for help on finding it. If you've been jump starting it every day, a loose jumper cable connection or connecting them backwards even for split second can blow that fuse. No lights on dash tells me it's not getting juice from the battery. Batteries can have 13 volts but no amperage... And can drain themselves if they go bad by means of a short across the plates inside. Did the place that tested it test it under load? If not, battery could be junk. Check the voltage with the headlights or heater blower fan turned on... Under load, the voltage will drop significantly if this is the case. Which would also cause going dead by itself. If battery is good, you have something drawing power when it's not supposed to be or a minor short somewhere. If no lights even with jumper cables hooked up, cables can go bad... But verifying you have voltage and amperage at the terminals and still no lights, id be looking at fuse save. if you don't find a blown one, you're probably in for an expensive repair. Tenderness must vehicles have multiple fuse boxes, check your book. If battery is definitely good, the lack of any power to your dash or lights indicates a blown fuse, or you may have bitten your ECU one of the times you jump started it. That's why they say on these newer cars NOT to jump start them unless absolutely necessary. The electronics aren't designed to handle the current surges that can occur when jump starting. Get a cheep trickle charger instead.",

I turned the car off and on a few times, and afterwards, it ran normally again. Could the cold weather alone be causing this, or is there a deeper underlying issue (I'm assuming the latter)?

Another mechanic advised that since the sign appears and disappears, try using liquid moli fuel injector at every gas refill for a month.

I'm not sure how rarely you drive your car, but in general, your battery shouldn't go dead even after a couple months of the car not being driven. It's possible you have a parasitic draw, which is when something draws a little bit of electricity over a long time, when it's not supposed to. If that's the case, that'll cause things like the cars battery going dead over night, or over a few days, and it will make your battery wear out a lot faster too. As far as driving enough, the alternator is really only designed to put a little bit of charge back into the battery to compensate from the amount used to start the car, and run the electrics until the alternator is able to kick in and carry that load. If your battery is dead, on some cars, even after 45 minutes of driving at highway speeds, the battery still won't be properly charged. Measuring battery charge is a complex thing. It's not just about voltage, there are a lot more factors than that. You need to test the battery's voltage with a small load, after it's been allowed to sit off a charger for a bit. Otherwise you just get the float voltage which doesn't mean very much.",

    "selftext": "I've had my 2003 RAV4 for about 5 years - 120k miles. Maintenance was not a high priority for the previous owner. Since owning the car, it intermittently throws a P0340 error. It always starts, and runs fine at highway speeds. The code will stay on for a few hours then disappear for several days. When coming to a stop in gear, the car tends to shudder and RPMs dip to say 350 before recovering to 550. Observed Issues - P0340 goes on and off - Engine bay seems to be quite hot. When done driving, you can almost hear a crackling. All wiring insulation in bay is brittle. Valve cover almost looks bubbled in spots. Car does live in Hawaii though... - maybe a rav thing, but sometimes transmission seems to hesitate to shift at freeway speeds sometimes going 3500 rpm in 2nd/3rd Things that seem to make it better: - Fewer/longer interval between errors right after an oil change. Used oil analysis didn't highlight anything significant. - When coming to a stop, shifting to neutral reduces vibration but car still vibrates noticeably. Steps Taken - ECM has been 'rebuilt' to address known tranny issues - Camshaft and crankshaft sensors replaced - Sparkplugs replaced - Original camshaft harness was cracked so spliced in a new one I'm hoping there's an parts/electrical fix to this rather than the elephant in the room - the timing chain. Any suggestions what else to try or troubleshooting steps to take?",

When refueling, if you fill the tank completely, allowing the trigger to disengage automatically, the fill tube will 'burp' and gas will spray out. I've tried several stations, slowing down pumping rate, leaving an air gap between fume capture hood and fill port. Nothing seems to work. Perhaps relevant - a friend did me the courtesy of filling the tank with diesel once. They had a mechanic drain the tank and lines but I did not receive any invoices nor did I supervise the work. The problem did not start immediately after this work. The car has also been in storage outside a few times, once with an ant colony building a home in the frame.

I have an 8’ extension cord running to the back of the van with the only thing plugged in is my dewalt battery charger. It’s fairly thin, I’m assuming 16ga but the label doesn’t say. It’s from Harbor Freight. Anyway the light on the inverter flashes after 10 minutes or so and the power cuts out to the charger. This doesn’t happen without the extension cord. Do I need a thicker gauge extension cord or a higher wattage inverter? All I’m running is one battery charger at a time. Thanks",

LS engines are all the same exact size dimensions wise, what makes them different is bore size for pistons and stroke size of crank that’s all internal that’s where displacement size comes from. So 5.7 to 7.0 liters are all identical in size. You wouldn’t want to put any of these parts on an LS3, the 243 heads are a cathedral (shape) port head. And the ls3 calls for rectangle (shape) port heads. The headers are for Ls1/ls6/ls2 heads like the 243s and 799 heads so that wouldn’t work. Ls2 intake manifold wouldn’t work with ls3 heads as they’re different port shapes and the 92mm throttle body would be pointless because the intake manifold you use on an ls3 weather it be stock/msd/f.a.s.t/holley can all run a 103mm throttle body. Idk what kind of power you’re looking for and your experience with LS engines but I’d say go full stock ls3 until you want to spend more on mods. Or keep the cammed/forged LS1 that’s in there now and add a pro charger since it’s already built for boost. If displacement size is your concern you can stroke the ls1 block from 5.7(345ci) to 6.3L(383ci)",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I want to take off to go camp but my 2001 Chevy express 2500 5.7l V8 is making these sounds. Can some please help me if you recognize it? I'm nervous it's the belt but belt looks fine or a cylinder it's wrapped on? I'm a solo female so I like to feel confident the van is good before going. I've had this month have had basic tune up and oil change. It's making these sounds like bubbling liquid sputtering on passenger side and than a rubbing weird new sound by the engine. No check engine and no noticeable low fluids that I can tell, but also a small leak like a drop every few minutes running down most bottom cylinder and onto the frame. Idk where it's coming from. Idk if it's correlated ? Any help, advice? I'm in Tucson AZ, thanks",

    "selftext": "I'm not sure if this is even worth posting but I'm frustrated and stressed out. I know nothing about cars and I just don't know where to go from here. I love my Rouge and I haven't had a single issue with her up until this point. At the end of September I took my 2017 Nissan Rouge to get an oil change at my usual shop. A few weeks later I started getting a low oil warning occasionally when I breaked too hard. I figured since that was the only time it happened it was probably an issue with the sensor. Then it started happening more often and when my husband checked the oil is was very low. We added more but unfortunately we were incredibly busy with our best friends' wedding so we did have time to take it in. At about a month and a half after the oil change I noticed a lot of smoke was coming from the tail pipe when I start up the car and it started to ideal roughly. I took it back to the shop and they said they couldn't find any issues but they did an oil flush to see if that helped. Since then the car has continued to smoke, ideal roughly, and every few weeks it needs more oil. We took it in this morning and the mechanic said his recommendation is to get a new car because our only option with this one is to replace the entire engine. My husband wants to get a second option but I'm worried that's just going to be a waste of time. Do you feel taking it to a different mechanic is worth it? Could we continue to drive the car for now and just routinely add oil or would that damage the engine? Thank you in advance!",

I plan on getting painted fenders to replace the nasty plastic ones they have but the bottom skirt and the bottom front bumper don't come without that plastic stuff. So if there are any parts or kits you guys find please let me know! I do plan on lowering the vehicle and also need help picking out rims. At the moment l'd like to make the whole thing just a glossy black. Looking for some inverted 3inch prolly rims chrome. But Yeah any parts or anything you think could be cool please link below thankyou! Also would like to re do the interior.",

    "selftext": "Car: cla45 2020 c118 Hi guys, I recently switched from summer to winter tires (I only have one set of rims, so I let a shop pull the summer ones off, and put the winter ones on. They are brand new btw) I never had winter tires on my car before since its quite new and I noticed always around 50-60kmh / 30-35 mph there is a sound that definitely comes from the tires, and I feel like it comes from all tires because the sound isn't particularly coming from one side. It sounds like a mix between driving on the lane markings and the sound of a squeaking drive belt (it's not as high pitched) but it definitely has a rubber sound to it. Is this normal? I also have a 2nd question since this MIGHT be related to this, I already asked this question in another subreddit but got no answer so far: I've been driving long distances because of holidays and after I took that long drive, I noticed when I drive relatively slow and steer to the right side a good bit (best example would be in a roundabout, EU streets) I hear a pretty loud \"crash\" noise from the back right part of the car. It sounds 1:1 like I'm hitting a curb even tho I haven't hit anything so far. There is no visible scratching or anything like that. Also its only for like 0.5-1 second and it doesn't keep rumbling if I drive in a circle, AND it's not 10 out of 10 times when I steer to the right. It's like a 50/50 chance that it will happen. Any advice would be highly appreciated!",

The colder it was, the worse it was. Gradually the temperatures it hated rose from the teens to the thirties. Now, if the temp is less than 40 I am only 50% sure my car will start in the morning. When it doesn't start, it can be jumped and it will start. The battery is new. It's been in the shop twice this winter already for this problem. Replaced spark plugs, air filter and battery as well as battery connectors to try to resolve this issue. Once the car starts in the morning, it will start all day without a problem. Again, if it doesn't start, it can always be jumped (thankfully we have a jumper box). What could be the issue here and how can I fix it for good? I'm dreading the rest of this winter.",

    "selftext": "Two part question as title says. 1) Took the car (it’s my husband’s car) to AutoZone to have the battery checked, kid said it was fine… but he also didn’t know what kind of car he drove when we were all making small talk (it was a Celica). Kid said it might be the starter, which yea it might be, but we want to rule out other components if possible. We went to pick up food and for whatever reason, husband left the headlights on and was aware of it. We ran in, chatted for a few minutes with staff there, got our food and left. We were there maybe 10 minutes, 15 tops. Car wouldn’t start. Luckily we have a battery/jumper pack and after letting it charge for a few it started up. Could it be the alternator then? But the battery was fine at autozone (allegedly) and the lights and other stuff haven’t been dimming/fading in and out. There have been times where it started fine, and other times when it struggled a little. That was the first time it did not start, and tonight was the second (with no lights left on). Jumped it again and it was fine. It’s also been very cold out if that matters. Is it possible to bypass some component by jumping? Or will it start only if the starter and etc works? 2) He’s had an intermittent check engine light for something to do with the evap for awhile. Wasn’t worried, kept driving. A couple days ago we pulled a code for the cat. Neither of which should affect shifting like that. Here and there you can hear/feel it sort of struggle or hesitate to shift gears. Yesterday and today, it got stuck in 3rd or 4th gear and wouldn’t go past 3000rpm (almost like it went into limp mode, but I don’t think it was in limp mode). Yesterday we pulled over and did this reset sequence we found on google, not sure if that actually did the trick or not, but we basically did a couple cycles of turning the car on and off for a few seconds, then it drove as normal. So I wondered if it was the TCM. Today it did it again, but fearing the car needing to get jumped to simply turn on, we just got off the way and took some back roads home at lower mph’s. We checked the trans fluid when we parked and it looked fine - fell on the higher range on the hot side and was red, clean, and transparent. I’m praying it’s not a mechanical issue with something going bad with the trans, because that’s an expensive fix, and this car may not be worth that price tag in repairs, but it’s his baby. We have a second car, which is mine, but that thing is an absolute bucket and I’m not sure that I trust it 100%. I digress. Any ideas on what either of these problems could be? Or do we have to run through a bunch of trial and error to eliminate this then that to figure it out? Thanks for your time. Edit: husband just found something that may suggest it could be the ECM, and by the sound of it, it has a lot of the symptoms/problems we’ve been experiencing.",

        "body": "You'd have to get a wiring diagram for the radio to be able to diagnose this properly. Depending on the design of the radio, this could be an internal problem or an external problem. Some radios have external amplifiers and others have internal ones. My guess is that somewhere in the amplifier, there's a break in the connection, causing it to not get power or signal when it's cold. As it warms up and the metals and parts expand, the connection is remade and it starts to work again. These sorts of problems are very common in cars, as the whole car is subjected to a lot of vibration as well as thermal cycling which often makes things like solder joints and electrical connections fail, because of the constant expansion and contraction of the metals as the temperature goes up and down. What I'd start with is checking if there's a separate amp or not in the radio circuit, and check if it has power when it's cold. If so, then I'd try to inject audio into it's input to see if it's actually amplifying the signal. From there, I'd go and look at the radio and see if the speaker connections or the amp output are actually outputting audio when it's on. If not, then the radio's internal amp/preamp may be having issues. Depending on how deep you want to go with this, you might be able to fix the radio, or replace it. But all this to say, your best bet is likely to start at one end and work to the other. Speakers all the way back through any amps to the radio, or from the radio all the way through any amps to the speakers. Judging by a few quick google searches, it seems that era of Nissan did have issues with amps/radios failing in exactly the way you describe.",
