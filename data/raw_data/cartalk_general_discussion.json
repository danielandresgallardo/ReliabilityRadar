They can be used interchangeably, provided both fuses come with a similar amp rating.\nHowever, a slight difference exists between the ATC fuse and the ATO fuse. The Automatic Transfer Case fuse is designed with an enclosed fuse element within the housing. This helps to protect the fuse from environmental factors that result in corrosion.\nConversely, the Automatic Throw Over fuse has an opening at the bottom, and this exposes the fuse element to corrosion.\nRx Mechanic\n| Rx Mechanic\nHave you wondered why fuses blow when you least expect it?

To clear that line out of my way, I need to remove a 24mm x 5mm fastener from a banjo fitting.\n[\nhttps://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54506322250_cfbe599c28_h.jpg\n]\nThe image in the link above is exactly 90° perpendicular to the previous image. The 24mm fastener is 1) ~40cm straight down, 2) at a 30° angle from horizontal, 3) is violently tight, 4) inaccessible from below or from the wheel well, and 5) accessible only from the top though within an ~10cm pocket with very little space for a typ. wrench swing arc.\nI cannot break loose this fastener. I have used a 24mm fixed and flex-head wrenches, and 6 and 12 point shallow sockets. In many, many attempts with all four tools, the 30° angle of the bolt head causes the wrench to “peel” off when I push–there is no room to get one’s free hand down there to hold the tool to the bolt. There’s only enough space above to get one click from the ratchet. The fastener is so far down from above that I can only manipulate tools with my fingertips. I bought a long handle flex-head 24mm ratchet wrench, which solves the “out of reach” problem, but the wrench still peels off the bolt when I put pressure on it. I haven’t ruined the fastener… yet.\nAll I am attempting to do is move this line out of the way to create some add’l space in an already ridiculously tight space to get on with the ACTUAL repair that awaits behind that black cover. What should have been a two hour job has breeched five full days. I need suggestions for a viable approach.\nSo I ask those with experience coming up with creative solutions to vexing fasteners and have experience with my predicament: What would you do/what tool(s) would you use to remove this fastener–and get it back on of course.",

I’m going to attach a 1/2-in wobble to it, and a 1/2-in 15/16-in shallow 6pt to the wobble. If this doesn’t work, then I will (tentatively) bail on that accursed fastener and remove the air plenum from the top of the engine with the hope that its absence will allow access to that part that I ACTUALLY NEED to work on!",

Assuming the battery is dead I have a buddy help me jump it, which was unsuccessful for a very long time. Eventually someone came with one of those portable car battery jumpers and it worked. I got it home, parked it and left it overnight. Drove it somewhere a couple days later, parked and went somewhere. After about an hour it died again, and I couldn’t jump it with my buddy’s car. Let it sit for about 4 hours and then was able to jump it. Ended up replacing the battery and drove it around for a little bit, but then it happened again. At this point I can’t get it started as it’s clearly not the battery. When I open the door or stick the key in the ignition dashboard lights come on. If I crank to start all power is killed and it takes some time before dashboard lights will come back on. If I turn the key to turn the radio on, accessories, etc. they may come on, but that can kill the power too. If I hold it on that setting and then try to crank it kills power, but this time it takes even more time before the dashboard lights or tail lights work. Negative and positive cables seem secured pretty tight on the battery. Cannot figure out what it would be. I’d try to tap the starter, but it’s difficult on these Civics as it seems like you have to jack them up and I’m street parked in a city. I’m also not the best with battery/electrical issues.",

As previously stated, the mileage improved from an average 24.7 to 25.5 mpg. It’s worth noting that, although I use the on-board the mileage calculator as a reference, with each fill-up I do a mental calculation to verify its approximate accuracy.

I had initially thought it might be related to the quality of gas I pumped just prior to noting the decline in gas mileage, but there was never any improvement related to subsequent refuelings.\nNothing I accomplished made a difference until the partial improvement when a fuel system cleaner was used…and I note no apparent problems with engine performance or idling stability, before or after the cleaner was used.\nThanks again for the ideas on things to check.",

Should all time constrained maintenance, such as changing your oil once every 6 months (even if you don’t go 5000 miles in that time) be strictly followed? Opinions seem to vary from person to person. I can see how if you just let your car sit, that it could cause some problems. But I figured if I start it monthly and get up to operating temperature, I should be ok? Moisture can find it’s way into the engine and transmission, bringing it up to operating temperature might help remove some of the moisture, so don’t have to worry about oxidization?\nNot entirely sure. Even if I take the stance that time doesn’t matter, I see the argument that it would likely matter, if we are talking years upon years.

The problem was intermittent at first, and related to the weather.  At first, I thought it was the transmission range sensor (basically like a neutral safety switch, though it also tells the PCM which gear you’re in).  I replaced that, and the problem continued.  Then I got out the factory service manual, traced the starter signal wire back to the PCM, and assumed it was a bad PCM.  So I replaced that, and the problem continued.  Then I replaced the ignition switch, problem continued.  This car doesn’t have an immobilizer, so I didn’t have to worry about that.  What ultimately solved the problem was a new starter, which required pulling the brake master cylinder, pulling the coolant expansion tank, pulling the intake manifold, pulling the fuel rail out of the engine, etc.  Probably the hardest-to-replace starter I have ever seen, though I heard replacing the starter on a Chevette is even more difficult.",

Yesterday I was stopped at a red light, and as soon as the light turned green and I accelerated, the car suddenly lost power and seemed to start running noticeably roughly in general (sort of like a “rough idling” sensation). The temp gauge also shot all the way up, although I don’t think any sort of temp warning light came on. However, the Service Engine Soon (SES) light did come on.\nLuckily, a large parking lot was to my immediate right, which I pulled over into and shut off the car. About 20 minutes later, I turned the car back on and the car seemed to have a rough start (more “rumbly” than usual) and the SES light immediately came on again; however, the temp gauge didn’t rise beyond where it usually sits whenever the car drives without issues.\nThe car seemed to idle a bit roughly, but I was able to gently drive maybe 20 feet forward without any noticeable issues. I didn’t want to risk trying to drive any further than that and turned the car back off.\nThe rough startup/idle sensation was similar to what I noticed about a year ago when the car had the issue of oil leaking down into the spark plugs and causing cylinders not to fire (all spark plugs were replaced when I got that fixed).\nI have also had to have the MAF sensors replaced twice (noticed a severe loss of power both times they went bad), although I don’t recall issues with rough startup/idling either of the times the MAFs went bad.\nDid not notice any smoke or fumes. No other warning lights came on aside from the SES light.\nI’m going to have the car towed to a shop on Monday, but does anyone have any ideas as to what the issue might be?\nThanks in advance",

But I also hesitated to bring it up b/c there’s not much to go on.\nHowever, with the cat out of the bag… a bad head gasket will often cause problems with engine compression. This means that the engine will run like crap (as yours did). And if the gasket breach includes a gap between the combustion chambers and the cooling jackets in the head, then hot exhaust gases will get blown into the coolant. That will mean pockets of really hot exhaust potentially hitting your coolant temp gauge - thus a spike on the temp gauge.\nBut I would not panic just yet. If this car has never overheated before, it would be odd for the head gasket to blow. Tho’ nothing is out of the question.",

Some engines needed to be replaced early in the car’s life due to faulty ignition and catalytic convertor parts that lead to rotor housing damage, or badly carboned apex and side seals that decreased compression to the point that the car becomes unreliable.\nOnly solution for low compression caused by wear is a full rebuild.\nCarbon caused compression loss can be cleaned out with heavy doses of carbon cleaner, to the point that there is a special procedure to perform carbon cleaning on rotary engines.\nAnd no, I didn’t stay at a Holiday Inn last night.\nI own a 2011 Mazda RX-8.\nBC.",

Hopefully this helps someone who stumbles across it,\n1st..check the ground that is under your intake plenum,you have 3 ground points, the one I referenced was one of my issues.\n2nd..look at your intake air temp sensor, it is combined with your maf sensor on your model.\n3rd..look at your fuel pressure, pay close attention to your gas gauge. Our models for some reason dont like to run with anything under 1/4 tank. Irregardless pay attention to your fuel at the rail.\n4th..This was my gremlin..look at your fuel injector seals on both the rail and the intake. My spitters were spittin where they shouldnt have been, leaving cute little pools of gasoline in nooks and crannies.\n5th..look at your upstream 02 sensor, downstream not so much.\n6th. This is one of the things I ruled out first, Look under your air pump, grab that thing that looks like a mini amplifier. That is a fuel pump resistor. My reasoning was that because my bucket would shut off when it got so warm, because resistor would get hot and trip. To verify this I crossed the 2 wire at resistor with no changes. Something to think about.\nlastly coolant temp sensor.\nIn conclusion, I pinky promise I had the exact same problem, now she purrs like a kitten and doesnt even think about stalling at stoplights.

    "selftext": "My 2013 Acura TL 2WD (153k mi) has developed a noise that sounds like a small electric motor near the left front wheel. The noise becomes apparent at around 30mph and increases in frequency as the vehicle speed increases. I’ve measured the frequency at about 250Hz at 30mph up to about 500Hz at 40mph. In park, I can rev the engine and not hear the sound; if I’m going downhill and shift into neutral, there’s no change to the sound. The noise started to become audible about a year ago (around the time I replaced the alternator - not sure if it was before or after, but the alternator is on the right side and the sound is definitely on the left) and has persisted through two different sets of all-season tires and a set of winter tires (on different rims). I replaced the front pads and rotors this weekend - the noise may be a bit quieter now but persists; during the change out I did not observe any obvious physical cause for the noise. Any suggestions are most welcome - I’m stumped!",

        "body": "I wonder if the responders to the Consumer Reports survey who drive the VW New Beetle treat their vehicles differently than those responders who drive the Golf and Jetta.  Years ago, I owned a 1971 Ford Maverick.  It had a rather poor repair record.  On the other hand, the Mercury Comet that was essentially the same car (engine, transmission, body) but with a different nameplate and a different grille and tail lights had an acceptable repair record.  I wrote a letter to CR asking about this discrepancy, because the Maverick and Comet were essentially the same.  The response I got in a letter from CR was essentially “that is the way the data came out”.\nTo me, as a statistician, this response didn’t make sense.  I finally stumbled on what I think was the answer while reading Popular Mechanics in the barber shop waiting for a haircut.  There was an article about the Plymouth Volare/Dodge Aspen twins where the owners of these vehicles had filled out a survey.  The average age of the Dodge Aspen owner was about 7 years greater than that of the Plymouth Volare owner.  I went to the library and found in another issue of Popular Mechanics a survey of Ford Granada/Mercury Monarch owners.  There was about the same difference in age with the owners of the Mercury Monarch having an older average age.  I surmised that the older owners bought the Mercury Comet and the younger group bought the Ford Maverick.  The older group probably serviced their cars more regularly and didn’t drive them as hard.  Hence what came out in the data of the CR survey may have be more attributed to the age group of the owners rather than any differences in the Comet vs. the Maverick.\nIt may be that the driving habits and attention to maintenance may be different for the New Beetle drivers as opposed to the Jetta drivers.\nI often think about the example one of my statistics professors used.  It seems that infant deaths in a New York hospital could be predicted from a measurement of the hardness of the asphalt on the street outside the hospital.  The softer the asphalt, the higher the infant mortality in the hospital, while the harder the asphalt was, the fewer the infant deaths in the hospital.  This doesn’t make sense until one realizes that the study was done in the 1930s when the hospital wasn’t air conditioned.   The hot rays from the sun softened the asphalt and kept the temperature high in the hospital thus leading to more infant deaths.  Correlation does not imply cause and effect as obviously the softness of the asphalt on the street has no direct effect on infant mortality in the hospital.  In the case of the VW, it probably isn’t related to whether the drive train and engine are installed in the Jetta or New Beetle, but the type of driver of the New Beetle vs. the Jetta.",

One is that the car has been in production for many years and maybe some of the body/electric stuff has been figured out.\nBut the more important part is that the Golf is mostly bought by car enthusiasts. The Beetle and Jetta ate more a first car for a beginner, or just an appliance for someone who needs transportation.

I’ve found that if I sit and don’t do anything to use the car (not even open the door) after a few minutes the radio light will shut off then I keep waiting for a sound that sounds like the rest of the system is completely shutting down, then for good measures I give it an extra few minutes because a couple times I’ve heard it make that sound again and then it starts. I have no idea what it is. No lights on my dashboard and no codes on reader (engine light isn’t on anyways). I only wonder if its a part of the security system, fuses or relay? I had a similar problem with a 2003 Olds Alero with the passlock and I had to wait with the key on until the security light stopped flashing and then I could start it but with this 2015 Ford Focus I can’t do the same, I have to leave the car alone for so long and then it will start.

At least under state Lemon Law guidelines. Now, every state has varying versions of a lemon law, some more comprehensive than others, but in a nutshell where I live the issue has to be a significant nonconformity which substantially affects the use, value, or safety of the vehicle. A backup camera that intermittently displays in b&w instead of color checks none of those boxes.\nEvery manufacturer is required to provide their retail customers with a\nno-cost\navenue to seek relief. This means the consumer can file a claim for the specific issue and request a non-binding arbitration hearing in which the arbitrator will award or deny a buyback or replacement vehicle. If the hearing goes in the consumer’s favor, the manufacturer has to comply. If the hearing goes against the consumer, the consumer is free to pursue further avenues at their own expense.\nSo a more detailed answer to your question is Yes, the OP should expect to keep the car unless they are willing to spend time and money pursuing it. Now generally speaking things are resolved before they get this far because car makers find it in their interest to have happy customers. But if there is no fix available yet, there’s not fix available yet.\nTwinTurbo:\nTake a look at this post thread\nWell, there’s an example of total entitlement and lack of reason. One guy stating he stood there and yelled at everyone at the dealer, claims he’s a victim of fraud, filed complaints with the state atty general and consumer agency, says he’s going to protest at the dealership. All over a nuisance complaint.\nReminds me of the guy who filed a lemon law claim because his mud flaps didn’t keep the sides of the truck clean.",

        "body": "Could be something wrong with the blend door or a design flaw.\nHere is a similar complaint\nWell, I heard back from the Nissan Investigate Team. It seems that their “investigation” is limited to them asking the dealership where I took the car what they found. The dealership had determined that the air mix doors were functioning to factory specs. They also determined by driving my car and another on the lot that the heater systems performed about the same. The conclusion based on that was that the heating system is working to factory specifications. I have learned that the heating system works automatically where, based on the temperature chosen by the driver, the air control calculates the target front air mix door opening angle depending on the selected temperature, intake temperature sensor, engine coolant temperature and rpm, and ambient temperature. However, the dealership tech did not check any of these factors, or did not measure the temperature of the air coming from the vents. According to documents found on line, the air temperature coming from the vents when the heat dial is set to 12:00 o’clock should be 75F. When set to the maximum, it should be 90F. When I check my air temp coming from the vents with the dial set to 12:00, the temperature is at most 50F or 10C. I argued all of these points with the Nissan rep and asked how to appeal their investigation. I also asked that this issue be reviewed by their factory engineers as the dealership was inept when it came to thoroughly investigating my issues and I felt that this is really a design problem. They said the case is closed, they will not consider further action, but I am free to take my car to another dealership for an assessment “at my own expense”. At this point I feel totally let down. I intend to take the issue to newspapers across the country to try to get Nissan to do something about this design problem as I don’t really know where else to turn. Any ideas about how to get them to budge and do the right thing would be welcomed.",

There were several codes that came up ranging from it being\nP 061A\nP06DA\nP22282\nP0521\nI looked underneath and saw right above the oil panthers a hole in the side of the block where there’s oil that’s spattered all over the place.  When I try to turn the car over it sounded like a bunch of rattling inside. I tried this once in that there was something wrong. Mind you I did this before I looked underneath and saw the hole. I’m assuming the block is fried. All these codes have to do with the internal control torque performance model and the engine and manifold oil pressure system. Also the oil engine control circuit which was stuck off. But I didn’t get any of these codes or alerts on my vehicle when I did the OBD2 scan.  It just seemed to come out of nowhere. The only codes I kept getting were my catalytic converter.  I’m assuming it’s a blown rod. Maybe even something with the oil pump possibly. I would assume anything with a hole blown through the side wall of the engine would result in catastrophic failure so is it salvageable or should I get a new engine?\nAlso there are no fault codes that are saying anything related to catastrophic failure for the engine and I still have coolant at the normal level and oil at normal level. And this is the next day so I’m wondering maybe even a head gasket blown??\n20250202_163027\n1920×1080 133 KB",

It seems like just the lower block I may have to replace but everything doesn’t look that bad I’ll send a picture in today or tomorrow. I think this might be salvageable. But when the pictures get posted you guys tell me what you think. I feel like if the pressure switch hadn’t gone out then everything might be fine. Oddly enough there’s no codes for any catastrophic damage or anything like that coming up in the OBD scan.  It’s just those codes. I did give a jump start to someone and I’m thinking that may have killed part of the battery because when I went to test the battery it only read 8.4 volts.  I feel like it may have done something to the battery or alternator or some of the electrical so I’m running through all the fuses first and then I’m gonna go and see directly what the codes imply and try either replacing it or seeing if it still functions at all.",

I have had the best wear from Michelins as well, BUT, the trade-off is that they may not corner as fast as a softer, grippier tire.  Racing tires wear out fast because the rubber is softer than on a normal tire so they can corner at higher speeds.  This is why some “high performance” tires for sportier cars wear out so fast.

        "body": "I like Michelin tires.  I buy them on sale when I can.  Whatever, right?\nBut anyway, one thing I’d like you to consider when you are buying ANY costly item, consider the difference in total price versus the price of the item.  By this I mean, if you are buying a refrigerator, you will probably spend at least $800 to get one that will fit your basic needs and last maybe ten years.  For another $400 dollars you might buy one that meets most or all of your needs and many of your wants, adds value to your home and will last as long as you own your home.  That’s the cost you need consider, the $400 extra dollars for a superior product, not the $1,200 total cost. The first $800 is spent either way.\nTires are a great example of this principle.  Your initial investment for very good tires is only the difference between the cost of cheap or mediocre tires versus the cost of much higher quality tires.  You have to buy tires now.  You will spend easily up to $400 for four decent tires that you will likely replace in another four years, or you can invest $200 more for a very good set of tires that will last (if rotated and properly inflated) as long as eight years.  Notwithstanding the difference in stopping distance, cornering, handling in wet weather, etc., just wear justifies the extra expense.\nOne last thing, when you buy a tire, look at the last three digits on the tire code, which indicates age.  The first two indicate the week in a given year that the tire was manufactures, and the last digit is the year.  So that 019 means the tire was made the first week of 2009.  Always buy as new a tire as possible, and never buy a six year old tire.",

I’m not sure how to explain it but its like when I press on the gas, the car feels like it’s bogging down before the RPM rises and sometimes I can hear and see the RPM hovering between 2-3k when cruising. This is the same issue that happens when the car is idling to which sometimes it feels like it’s gonna stall but it doesn’t.\nThe car has about 160k, has had the spark plugs replaced roughly 4-5 months ago, air filter changed a month ago and the MAF was cleaned using a cleaner.\nI don’t currently have a engine light but a code I keep getting is P0622 (which is strange as the timing chain was changed a few months ago by a mechanic after my water pump failed and was replaced) which pops up and disappears after a drive cycle or two.\nAnother code I get is P0420 in which I bought a cheap thermal thermometer and checked the catalytic converter temp (pre car and post) and the temperature difference was over 190F.\nI was wondering if I could get some advice on how I should tackle this before throwing parts at it.\nOne big thing that comes to mind is, I tried doing the job myself and pooched the timing, bending some intake valves by foolishly cranking the engine out of time. Because of this I got fed up, took the head off, replaced the bent valves, got the timing as close as possible, which still caused timing codes somehow, and brought it to the mechanic who had to redo my job (he was actually surprised I was able to drive the car there as I said the timing was off). After which he stated he didn’t see any bent valves after he finished the job.",

First of all the ABS indicator was turned on and second, some times when he breaks, the ABS system activates like when you break on a snowy and icy road, only it is summer.\nI checked the car using live data on a scan tool, which showed the picture above. I thought that maybe it could be a half broken sensor. It was cheap and easy to change, so I thought that this would be a great way to eliminate that possibility. But nothing changed, so now I am considering a troublesome connection in the wires going to the sensor. But I do not have a wiring diagram, so before diving deep into a wiring system with blindfolds on, I thought that I would see if this could somehow be something else that I should rule out first?",

There was some larger blobs of grease on sections of it I removed with a Qtip. But the real issue was rust had formed on the seating area for the sensor.

Spin the wheel with your scanner on it and jiggle, especially right at the connector.  I had a go-round recently with an invisible problem right at a connector. This was a ground wire, and I had cleaned it all up and all appeared to be fine. But apparently right where the wire entered to connector there was some manner of fatigue/breakage going on that allowed it to randomly lose and regain continuity.

I recently acquired my neighbors 2012 Bennche Bighorn 700 UTV.  It sat out in his yard without being moved for over 2 years, but was running when he parked it.  I got it home and discovered  the gear shift fan gear had froze up due to it sitting in the weather.  The part that pivots was frozen where it is inserted into the housing, which I freed up.  I put a fresh battery on it, tried to crank it, and only hear a faint click up under the hood, which I assume is the solenoid.  I checked the solenoid and I am getting 12.2 volt to it and 11.79 on the side going to the starter without turning the key to crank.  I am getting 12.2 volts at the starter when I turn the key to the on position and 11.72 when I turn the key to crank.  Correct me if I am wrong, but don’t I have a bad solenoid?

A car-battery with no current draw should measure close to 12.6 volts.   That said, if you are measuring at least  11.7 volts on both of the starter motor terminals (B and S),  with the key in “start”, that should be enough to crank the engine. Measure these accurately,  by probing between the starter terminal and the starter case.   If that checks out, makes sure the engine manually-rotates freely (by wrenching the crank-shaft bolt.  Might try removing the spark plugs and trying the starter motor again, may unstick something.   Car starter motors usually provide access to the post-solenoid terminal.

A local shop checked “everything” and said it is the compressor, but they also said they don’t work on Nissans which is kinda odd.\nSo, the kid is done and car is back in CA. Freon level on the low port is fine\nWhen I turn the AC on, the radiator fan does not turn on. I let the car warm up and the radiator fan would still not come on. There are two connectors in the radiator. When I turn the AC on, the lower connector does get 12 volts but when I plug it in the fan would not turn. I am not sure what the upper connector does. Did not unplug it-yet.\nWhat baffles me is that the car does not overheat and the kid states the the temp has not gone up either. There are no codes, oil and oil cap and coolant look fine, so I don’t think we have a blown head gasket/overheating/etc and the car drives fine.\nLooking online, the radiator fan on these cars are a real weak point. What I don’t understand is the absence of overheating.\nI would rather not take it to a shop as the fan replacement is well within my scope.\nAny thoughts an input appreciated.",

The only engine offered is a 3.3L V6, which would have two head gaskets.\nSecond, you don’t say what kind of “seepage” this is.  Engine oil?  Most engines have minor valve cover leaks, which drip down, and appear to be from the head gasket(s).  Coolant?  Check for leaking frost plug(s), hoses, or crossover pipe.  Some V6 engines have a coolant pipe located between the two cylinder heads, and if this leaks, the coolant can run down the engine, appearing to come from somewhere else.\nThird, this type of engine requires way too much effort to perform a DIY head gasket repair, and having this done professionally would be way too expensive.\nIf you have any doubts about the condition and reliability of the engine, my advice would be to not buy this vehicle, and keep looking.",

Above this point the head was silver in color and looked like typical 8 year old oxidized aluminum.

I should mention that I recently replaced my radiator, which required a lot of knocking around in the tranny area, but that was about a month before the fuse blew.\nI couldn’t find any damaged wires or loose connections around there (or anywhere else).\nThe fuse in question is also associated with the charging system and rear defogger, but I disconnected the low voltage alt cable and the defogger switch in the dash, and it still blew.\nAny ideas?\nThanks in advance,\nJonas",

I said take it to a shop because it’ll take me days to get to the bottom of it and they’ll be upset with me for being slow. So it sat at the shop for a week and then they finally got to it. It was something like $150 for up to 2 hours of diagnostics or something like that. They couldn’t figure it out. The plastic was pulled up over the door sill where some wires go and the screws on the bottom of the cluster were out. I don’t they they really had any idea where to start.\nI said no more and it was towed back. It took me a couple days and I had to purchase the wiring diagrams. A CAN bus wire going down to the electric power steering was broken down there. I was obvious since the CAN bus impedance was twice the spec. The ECU was disconnected from everything else, including the chip key reader.\nIn other words, you may have more skill for fixing this than your shop does. Is your time worth $200+ per hour?",

There’s really only\none\nway to clean a cat–unbolt and remove it, and clean it with brake cleaner or carburetor cleaner.  Wait for all of the solvent to evaporate, then reinstall it.\nMany people here will tell you that it’s impossible to clean a cat, and that if you are getting a catalyst efficiency code (P0420) you’ll need to buy a new one.  However, that is not true.  Assuming that the ceramic honeycomb isn’t damaged, cleaning\nwill\nwork, especially if the problem is oil consumption or unburned fuel due to poor compression on one or more cylinders.  I have pulled and cleaned the cat to get vehicles through emissions, and it works.  If the engine has been repaired, the problem will stay away for a while, maybe even a long while.  If not, the trouble code will probably come back soon, but as long as you already took the car through emissions and renewed your license plate, whatever.\nAnd of course, don’t forget that catalyst efficiency codes can sometimes result from worn-out O2 sensors, especially the rear sensor.  If you’re going to pull and clean the cat, you might as well replace both O2 sensors with a quality brand, such as Bosch or Denso.  NEVER use a cheap, generic brand, such as Duralast or O’Reilly’s house brand.",

I want to give to mechanic shop earlier than codes will appear (due to some personal reason). I was reading on google, what could be upcoming service (and its expense) and I see different results. It could be either of these -\n(1) B1 = Oil and oil filter change, brake inspection, fluid level check, tire rotation, etc. + Tire rotation\n(2) At 60,000 miles, Acura usually recommends some major service items\n(3) B1236, A comprehensive service covering oil, filters, transmission, differential, and belts.\nI didn’t notice any issues so far. Tires were changes around when it was around 45,000 miles and brake shoes were changes 2 years back.\nI have not done timing belt change yet and it is as original. I will keep it for more time, definitely at least for 5 years. Car is 10 years old now, but at 60,000 miles. Should I get it changed or ask mechanic, if he should check and let me know ?\nSomeone please advice on this.\nThanks",

The lifter failure, more of a tick really, was a fairly new symptom. But I stopped driving the vehicle and even towed it to his shop, 77 miles from my home, to prevent any further damage. He assured me the lower end was sound when he recommended so many adjustments to the top end.\nThats why I agreed to replace the heads, springs, upgrade to a better cam, etc… he convinced me that should ensure another 200k miles of use.\nAfter replacing everything, he was apparently unfaliliar with tuning it properly. His experience was with the gen 4 chevy motors apparently. Specifically, the 5.3L and not the 6.2L direct injection set up.. He didnt realize they were configured differently until he began the process.\nHe struggled tuning for 3 days. He kept gettting misfire codes he couldnt figure out. An entire day he couldnt get it to run at all, then couldn’t keep it running, a day where he broke 2 plugs while trying to drive it. Then the engine finally siezed and left him stranded apparently? It was a train wreck.\nI\nHence, why I am so anxious for others knowledge here. I feel he should have stopped prior to engine failure and gotten help tunning or diagnosing the issue. It seems fairly irresponsible to experiemnt on my dime and someone else property like that.\nIdk should I even keep giving him a chance?\nAt the end of the day, if he does fix, what would I even owe him $ for? Should this all be on him or his insurance at this point? or should I still be liable to pay something? I am a fair man and never expect something for nothing. But I also dont like to pay something and get nothing in return…\nIf i just tell him stop all work, and find someone else to fix it, do I owe him for any of this mess?  This is a tough one… but the origional job would have been around 5k. I just cant justify giving him 5k for this… even if he does.try spinning it like it wasnt his neglegence that caused engine failure. Especially after asking him to be sure these repairs had no risk of anything like this before he proceeded.\nThanks again for all advice\nAll help and advice is greatly appreciated.",

TDC for the camshaft might be marked under the valve cover I forget. Anyway, when they are both set correctly, you set up the belt there there is no slack in the forward (crank pulling the cam) direction before you rotate two revolutions. Then you verify if it it may need to be adjusted by a notch. The spring sets the tension and then you tighten the bolt to fix it in place on the back (slack) side.

I know that a lot of the older 4cylinder cars were about 14* between teeth IIRC and if a tooth off, you could get it to start good but run like crap, or get it to run good but hard to start, you adjusted the ignition timing to go between starting good and running good, that was with 1 tooth off… So you could get it to running good with the ignition timing and then see where it ended up at idle, if it ended at 20* advanced and the base should be 6* advanced, then that meant you were about 14* off or a tooth off…\nOn a typical performance engine, you are only advancing or retarding the cam 4 degrees at the crank with a 3 keyway crank sprocket which is 2 degrees at the cam… You can also use offset keyways to get the cam 100% straight up when dialing in a performance camshaft…\nI hope I didn’t get anything backwards, I kept getting interrupted while writing this… lol",

The actuator is blocked”. They apparently fixed this under the extended warranty for the vent value - they installed a plug and performed a software update - NO CHARGE. I picked up the car. The light was off. A few days later the “Check Engine” light came back on. I brought the car back to the dealer yesterday (4/21). The second problem (which he noted on 4/8 and he was able to confirm) was a “sensor that is part of the gas tank”. This repair will cost $4,372. The service advisor I spoke to was not able to tell me what would happen if I didn’t do the repair. When pushed he said, the first thing that would “probably” happen would be the fuel gauge would not register but that the car could also have problems starting. Apparently, this error is all tied into the electronics.\nI guess I’m just looking for validation before I replace the gas tank.\nI appreciate the advice.",

I have read here about quick struts, but have not found them for this car model.

Are you going to keep this car for a while longer?\nI’d go to another mechanic, maybe 2 of them, and let them give you quotes for all the labor and parts.\nThat is essentially what I have in mind: three quotes, unfortunately all from mechanics who are new to me. Mainly I am trying to figure out if there is a reasonable way for me to do the shopping for parts. I have done so with more straightforward installations like distributors and a window, which has worked out well. But this repair appears more complicated in terms of parts.\nWhy have this expensive repair done? Because of long-term reliability of the car. It is running fine overall. The fact that the struts happen to need repair at age 38 years does not suggest that it is a flaky car. The previous notable repair was two and a half years earlier. Before that, a couple years earlier. Along the way there are the routine maintenance/repair items that any car requires, like the timing belt (every six years). And tires – every six years, including this year, even though the tires are in good condition with good treadwear.",

Also the dashboard gauges show whatever, sometimes the speedometer and RPM gauge show 0 even though im driving.. Sometimes they work normal though.. And when the car is parked and turned off, the fuel gauge is usually at MAX even though it should be at 0, so there is some electrical problem going on..\nCould it be faulty ECM? Bad grounding? I ordered OBD1 adapter so maybe it will help me locate the problem.. Also I removed the 3 connectors behind dashboard and put them back in, I dont think they are causing the issue.. And there are couple of blown light bulbs in the dashboard, I couldnt find similar bulbs from local stores but I dont think they are causing this issue either..\nAny suggestions?",

I see values on the internet  in the 25 ft-lb range for the Corolla in general, matching up with Nevada’s estimate above.  I don’t see anything though for your specific make/model, which I presume is Corolla derived.\nConsider that the manufacturer has  a conflict of interest for this spec.  They’d rather error on the side of too tight than too loose.  After all, loss of engine oil is a much worse problem to deal with compared to having to fix the threads in the oil pan or drain plug or replace the oil pan.  I’m a diy’er and have changed the oil in my driveway for my cars for years.  For my own Corolla, just a few years newer than yours, I can tell you how I do it, never had a problem damaging the threads on the drain plug or oil pan.\nFirst off – I think this is very important to prevent thread damage and leaks – I always use a new gasket.   When tightening the oil drain plug I use a 12 inch handle ratchet/socket and hold it with one hand about 6 inches from the plug and tighten it just so it starts to snug up, then another 1/8 of a turn.    I’d guess about 15-20  foot pounds.\nI usually buy my drain plug gaskets at Toyota, in a batch of 10.   If I discover no washers are left in the middle of an oil change, I don’t drive to Toyota in the other car to buy some new ones.  Instead --now I’m not recommending this mind you – I’ll make my own appropriately sized gasket from 3 mm thick neoprene gasket material I keep on hand.\nAnd I carefully clean the area off, then visually check for leaks from the oil filter and drain plug after doing an oil change, both at idle rpm then at higher rpms.",

I’d never heard of that until a year or two ago, and suddenly I’m hearing of it almost on a routine basis. Just last year a dealer shop changed a friend/neighbor’s oil pan because his threads were stripped…  and the dealer that did this is the only shop that has ever worked on his car, including oil changes. He himself hasn’t; he’s too disabled to even try. He bought the car new from them in 2012 and has always taken it there only. They charged him $500 or $600, I forgot exactly. I was pissed. He was pissed too, but his wife had told them to go ahead.\nIF a dealer told a customer that the threads could be easily and inexpensively repaired for whatever the shop would charge and that they had the option of having the pan replaced for hundreds of dollars and the customer opted for a new pan, I wouldn’t be bothered at all, but that isn’t what seems to be going on.

    "selftext": "Okay be ready for a longish post and please bare with me its all relevant to the issue.\nTo start we are working on a 1988 Chevy Astro Van Cargo, only has 2 front dash speakers.\nWhen I first purchased the vehicle their was an aftermarket stereo from the 80s installed. Very basic with a cassette deck. There were also other wires hanging about from an old cell phone that had been hooked up, various fuses were the wrong amperage etc. I removed all loose wires that went to nothing and changed back all the fuses to stock amp.\nNow recently i removed the speakers and 80s aftermarket radio and installed a new sony with 2 dash speakers. Initally i could not get power to the radio for whatever reason so i thought i had the wiring wrong. I asked my brother and he said for whatever reason the main wire was not getting power. This must be why i had a mysterious extra wire tied into the old unit with an inline 3amp fuse. I dont remember where in the fuse box they had it plugged but it was not in a space that had anything else going to it. Anyway, I had to end up tying that wire into the power and dimmer wire and have it in with the radio fuse which is 10 amp. I know that probably sounds sketchy but it was my brothers idea and now the radio at least has power and also works.\nHeres the issue, now that radio has power, my dash lights are also always on when i have the ignition on. Also the radio works as it should but when i turn the ignition off every thing goes back to factory settings. It does not hold memory. I have read this could be a wiring issue. (duh ahaha) or there not being sufficent power going to the radio to save the settings. Luckily the radio has a battery voltage option and its getting plenty of power.\nI suck at electrical but i have done radios myself on 90s vehicles with no issues. Please give me your best advise. I have included photos as well and can send more upon request. I dont have the money to get it professionally installed or i would have already done that.

I have confirmed I have good fuel pressure, it has no spark, the crank fuel is disabled, but my computer says crank shaft sensor has no fault. Although I know it can still have a fault even if my computer doesn’t read one, and I don’t think it is the alarm system that caused crank fuel disconnect because when I turn the key the alarm is not flashing at all. Any ideas, thoughts, advice on what to check next?",

They determined that the seal on the “upper” oil pan has a very small leak, with it accumulating down below on the frame and occasionally dripping from there. Unfortunately, it’s a $2600 repair; given the position of the upper oil pan it requires dropping the transmission to replace the seal.\nAs the car has 104,000 miles, I’m on the fence about whether to make the repair or sell and buy a new car. In the meantime though, my question here is whether there is a specific risk to the car if I just monitor the oil level and if necessary top it off. The leak is so small that in the past 3 weeks the oil level on the dip stick still shows Full.\nI’ve seen other online thread where people have talked about doing that and it not being an issue to have lost a quart between oil changes. On the other hand,\nanything\nfrom Kia or other similar sources says absolutely do not delay in getting an oil pan seal leak fixed.\nThoughts?",

IMO the money saved on gasoline is never worth the extra spent on a more fuel efficient vehicle.\nI’ve saved a whole heap of money on gas ever since I bought a PHEV.  Obviously, the actual gas mileage will vary, depending on whether one activates the ICE, or not.\nMost of my driving is done in EV mode, and I typically drive 900-1000 miles on 5-6 gallons of gas.   My personal best was 1,745 miles on 6.68 gallons of gas.   Just so nobody thinks I’m bragging, I’ll leave it to others to do the math on that.\nOf course, I do have to pay for the electricity that I use to recharge it at home, but because I am a member of a\nCommunity Solar\nprogram, I get a 20% discount on my electricity without installing my own solar panels.\nA couple of months after I bought the vehicle, I calculated my cost of electricity vs miles driven, and it was less than half of what I would have spent on gas with my previous vehicle, which got 24-29 mpg.",

The chemistries are the same.\nThere is something about the 12 Volt starting & marine batteries that is different. The 12 Volt seal lead acid batteries used in electric sooters and UPS units will fully charge at 13.5 Volts, given enough time. Whatever they did with the flooded starting and marine, they will not fully charge at 13.5V. Not sure if it’s the lead calcium or lead antimony for vibration resistance, or they modified them somehow to make them more tolerant of vehicle 14.4V charging systems, but they do not charge at 13.5 or even 13.8V. I learned this the hard way.\nCame across a discussion forum where someone described the exact same thing. “I’ve had a lot of experience with the 12 Volt marine batteries. Mostly bad.” Said they have to charge at 14.4 Volts for 4 hours to fully charge. The others like the 6 Volt aren’t like this.\nI put a new marine battery on a solar charger set at 13.8. One of the FVP from menards. It got drained once a week or so and it took 2 to 4 days to charge back up. It is now badly sulfated and at half capacity after only 10 months.

I took it into a high school mechanic program to do the repair.  I sent 6 spark plugs along with the repair, figuring it would be a good idea to have the plugs replaced while they had the engine exposed for the filter repair.  After completing the repair, the teacher (who is a great guy and has done repairs for me in the past) informed me that the van was misfiring.  He ran a bunch of tests, and then informed me that the only thing he could figure was that the catalytic converter must be dirty/possibly beginning to fail.  It was not having this issue prior to putting in the new plugs? He recommended I try using a catalytic converter cleaner like cataclean to see if it helps.  I tried it, knowing that it was most likely not going to help and it did not.  My question is, is it possible that this issue has nothing to do with the catalytic converter, but maybe one of the spark plugs was bad?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks!",

One of the mounting bolts is so tight that the socket would not keep a grip on the bolt head, no matter how hard we tried to force the socket onto the bolt head. We had tapped on it as best we could with a hammer and metal rod, we heated the area with a torch, no luck. Of course, very little access to this bolt head, so impossible to use an impact hammer. The extra leverage of a breaker bar made no difference, the socket just kept slipping off the bolt head, no matter how hard we tried to push the socket against the bolt head.  My buddy saw a hack online about gripping the bolthead with a small piece of latex rubber, like from a balloon. But how would a professional deal with this? Actually, it has been several months now since we attempted this, and so I don’t remember if we would have had room in front of the hub to get my oxycetylene torch cutter in there to blow out the seized bolt, and without doing fatal damage to something.",

Removing the engine undercover showed that it had collected a small puddle also. I added a quart of coolant and drove without the undercover, and the dripping seemed to stop, possibly because the increased air flow may have carried the coolant constantly, before it puddled.  Re-installing the cover re=started the puddling. Of course, I am watching it (and the temp gauge and engine performance) closely. 200 miles of driving caused the coolant level to fall a little less than a quart.  I seem to recall that dyes are sometimes used to locate small leaks. What does an experienced mechanic do?

I also drove the car for a few days without the undercover, and could not find drops when parked.

Like you,  I couldn’t find the source of a small coolant leak so I replaced the water pump on a flyer. I did this even though there was  no obvious leak in engine compartment,  nothing from water pump leak hole, no hose leaks I could see, etc…  It was time anyway, pump was original to the 200k mile car.  It’s a pretty big job on the Corolla, timing belt covers, jacking engine, etc.  Only after  I got everything removed enough to access the water pump bolts, then I could see the leak.  Water pump shaft seal was obviously leaking.  New water pump solved the leak.\nI think a cooling system pressure test w/UV  dye would have worked pretty good too.        I didn’t have any of that equipment though, so I just gave the wheel of  fortune  a whirl, and fortunately got lucky.   The Corolla had been removed from the road for several years  anyway due to a pandemic/emissions-testing issue.",

That might be wise advice, because a friend had one of the Nissan’s with the early CVT’s that crapped out before 75K miles.  But… mine’s still going fine, and non-dealership mechanic told me that he only goes for the transmission service if there’s real symptoms, since as most of you probably know, what you’re flushing out isn’t pure liquid and can cause damage.  My warranty runs to 100K and I plan to sell it before that, but I don’t want to leave someone with a ticking time bomb of a poorly maintained vehicle.  Am I creating a problem for the next owner by selling at 95K and never having it serviced?  Or worse, am I risking stranding myself at some point even though the performance is great?\nThanks!\n=MM=",

    "selftext": "Hi. I have a 2006 Toyota Corolla and it won’t start. When I turn the key, lights come on on the dash, it shows me my mileage, it lights up the check engine and check battery lights on the left-hand side of the dash, it shows me how much gas is in the tank, the clock goes on, and my overhead lights turn on. But when I turn the key, the car doesn’t start. Sadly, I really know nothing about cars and how they work, so when I’ve read online people say that there is or is not “clicking,” I’m not sure what that means. I\nthink\nthat there is a single clicking sound when I first try to turn the key it, but there is definitely no further clicking after that. Also, there is no sound from the engine at all, no other sounds from under the hood, just silence.\nI tried doing a few tricks I read recommended online, one called “key cycling,” or something like that, where you turn the key to start it ten times, then let it wait for five minutes and try starting it again, and that didn’t work. I tried tapping on the battery terminals with a shoe, that didn’t work. I turned the dome lights on in the car to see if they would flicker or go out when I tried to start it, and they did not flicker or go out, but stayed evenly illuminated the whole time. However, the digital clock display by the radio control panel did go off when I turned the key to start it – don’t know if that means anything. I read that if the overhead lights were to flicker or go out when you try to start the engine, it would mean the battery is low or dead.\nI hadn’t started the car in about a week, and that is somewhat normal. I don’t remember when I last got the battery replaced, but there is a sticker on it which says 2/21, which may mean the battery is 4 years old. It’s probably what Walmart calls a “2 year battery,” which means it had a warranty of 2 years. The battery terminals don’t look corroded, just dirty, at least as far as I can tell.\nSince it seems there are some signs it might not be the battery, I have looked around for what people online say might be the problem. I have seen people mention the words solenoid, starter, cables, fuses, but as I said already, I’m deeply ignorant.\nI checked the oil, and it appears to have oil, thank God.\nWhat might be the problem? I have AAA, so I plan to call and see if they can jump start it. If it’s not the battery, though, I want to be prepared when it is taken to the mechanic, for what they might tell me is wrong, and how much it should cost. Should I get Toyota or off-brand parts?\nI will be very grateful for any help you can offer. Many thanks.",

While the car is running, the alternator charges the battery. It’s likely in the starter-alternator-battery loop that the problem exists. If you can remove the battery and take it to an auto parts store, they can test it for you. You might as well call AAA. You pay for it and maybe they can start it for you. If not, they can tow it to a repair shop. If you take it to a shop you trust, then you should trust their choice of parts.

In fact, when I bought this car, I was super-busy at work, and since I did not have time to do a DIY timing belt replacement, I paid a professional shop to do it, over $1000, and they actually did a lousy job, which I discovered years later, when I took the engine apart to replace the head gasket.\nThe professional mechanic replaced the original hose clamps with worm-drive hose clamps, and tightened them super-tight to the point that they were cutting into the hose.  Also, when installing the timing belt on this engine, you are supposed to set it to maximum tension (indicator on the tensioner points to notch on bracket), rotate the engine a few times by hand, then relieve some tension until the indicator on the tensioner points to a pointer on the tensioner bracket).  Of course, they left it at maximum tension, which would have caused the belt to fail prematurely, and ruined the engine.  Obviously, once I took it apart to do a DIY head gasket, I put a new timing belt, water pump, and tensioner kit.\nThanks again to whoever can get me the GM part numbers for those two OEM hose clamps.  It would be very much appreciated.",

I’ve\nnever\nhad a situation where I didn’t buy tires as set.  Every time, I’ve bought tires for any car or truck I’ve ever owned. All four tires were worn within 1 or 2 32nds of each other and it made zero sense not to replace them all at once.\nmercury07:\nshould the tires in the front be matching?\nYes, but the new tires should also go on the rear.  So in your situation, if replacing all the tires isn’t possible (you didn’t mention the wear level, so maybe the front’s are less worn?) then I guess you’d just replace the rears. Perhaps one of the tire experts will chime in with more concrete answer.\nmercury07:\nHow do I check TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing tires?\nNormally, the batteries in the TPMS sensors get replaces as part of the standard mounting/balancing procedure.  I’ve haven’t come across a tire shop that didn’t do that as a default service.  As for resetting them yourself.  Different manufacterers use different systems.  Some you need a reset tool,  for some there’s a reset procedure you need to do. And some, the ones on newer Fords, you don’t have to do anything, even when you rotate the tires, the TPMS will automatically detect the wheel position being moved and automatically adjust.  I’m not sure how it does this.  I assume it has something to do with the TPMS sensors comparing the RPM of the wheel/tire vs. what the ABS sensors are reading, and figuring out what tire is in what position based of those numbers.",

So no need to advise me to replace the belt in that engine… just in case. It has 3500 miles on it. Replace the car…yeah, maybe, but at least for now I don’t have to worry about the belt breaking.\nMy purpose here is to find authoritative information from experts, clarifying unverified bits I’ve found about early Sienna timing belt engines, in relation to the VVTi design.\nHere’s what consensus seems to say:\nFrom what I have found from uncertain sources, the 1998 - 2000 (first generation) Sienna\n3.0L engine\nis a\nnon-interference\ndesign. If the belt breaks, you’re stuck. Get a tow, have the belt replaced, and you’re back in traffic.\nFor the 2004 - 2006 Sienna (second generation)\n3.3L engine with VVTi\n, I’ve found fairly convincing information that\nthis IS an interference engine\nand that if a belt breaks, the damage is extensive and thus probably not cost effective for a car that old.\nThat leaves the 2001-2003 (first generation)\n3.0L engine with VVTi.\nI have no information on the interference risk for that engine.\nI don’t know much about VVTi, except that it must have some performance / efficiency advantage.\nWhat I don’t know is if VVTi itself is a design which makes a Sienna engine susceptible to valve damage if a belt breaks. That is:\n• is VVTi the design that creates the Interference problem?\n• or is the 3.0L engine a non-interference whether VVTi or not?",

I had a general understanding that VVTi changed the timing of valve movement.\nThe question is – specifically in the 2001-2003 Sienna engines – do the valves actually get in range of the pistons?\n@Tester\nsays above that Gates described those engines as non-interference.\nBefore I posted this question, I called one well established Toyota dealership asking for first the service department and then the parts department person, with no luck: none would talk with me. It just occurred to me that someone in the local automotive machine shop might have an answer based on work experience.\nAs for your timing belt advice, that is exactly my position. Prove the job was done, or I have to judge the price for the car as including the cost of a t-belt job.\nYour reply was helpful, thanks!",

I know you can’t just inspect the belt visually to judge its condition. I try to explain the consequences of a broken belt: late at night, or in rush hour traffic, or far from civilization, etc. I’ve given up on that mission!

If it was not right here, then most likely (but I’m not certain) on the youtube channel “TheCarCareNut.” The channel is run by a man who was a long-time Toyota master diagnostic technician at a dealership. He then opened his own shop outside of Chicago (TCCN Automotive) which now is highly successful. Then came his YT channel, now with 1.38 million subscribers. AMD (the shop owner and presenter on the channel) gets relentless praise from his viewers and his customers.\nAnyway, bottom line…I’m not sure where I heard that.\nI just called a local Toyota dealer and spoke to a service advisor who said he’s been working for Toyota a very long time. The first thing he said was that in all his time, he’s seen very few belts break, and when they DO break, it’s at start up, meaning low RPM, and probably no damage. If that’s accurate, at least it puts to rest some concerns about having a belt break\nwhen you’re driving in heavy traffic\n. But he did not distinguish between the three engines in question: early 3.0L, 3.0L w/VVTi, and 3.3L w/ VVTi.\nSo he didn’t fully answer my question, but his experience eases my concern about a belt breaking.\nAnd that is supported by one Sienna that I posted about here a year ago: a 2004 with under 80,000 miles, still running the original belt. Plus my own 1999 Sienna which I estimate had the same belt for about 13 years before I had it replaced at 323k.\nI would think that there might be some “official” Toyota documentation answering my original question, but I don’t know how to look for that.",

I drive hard every 2-3 months on the Highway 1 “race course” heading up North on the California coast\n(the fun stuff).\nI read\nthis guy\n.\nMy main objective is to make the car last as long as possible.\nCurrently my shop uses 5W-40 full synthetic every time the car is serviced (not sure what brand) and I’ve been topping it off with Mobil 1 5W-50 advanced full synthetic in hopes of reducing oil burning off with the thicker viscosity. The manual recommends BMW synthetic 5W-30 or 5W-40.\nI’m wondering whether high mileage synthetic might be appropriate and whether I should go with a big name brand or maybe a specialized oil like Liqui Moly or similar. Price isn’t really of concern unless it’s significantly more expensive than a viable alternative.\nAlso I only drive ~1500 miles a year so I’m also wondering if since I do a lot of city driving I should change the oil every 6 months or so.\nThanks!",

I believe the passenger side caliper is locking up; it makes a noise on the highway and drifts to the left when braking hard. Also the passenger side wheel gets too hot to touch, while the driver side wheel is just warm.\nI suspected the caliper needed replacing and when I opened the piston there was a bunch of very fine light brown grit. Bought a new caliper today, but it seems even the new caliper is not releasing. It just seems to clamp tighter and tighter without releasing when I pump the brake pedal. When the car if lifted I can’t even budge the passenger wheel by hand. The driver’s side caliper releases, however. Is this a pinched brake line?

It is the same exact part, same fittings (m10 x 1) same clamp location, same pressure rating and diameter but it’s $15 instead of $30 for the part that they’ll tell you fits the ford escape.\nHi Joshua:\nThe Duralast part you installed was designed to be used on Ford Escapes built between 2001-2007.    Yours is a 2012 Escape.\nDo you know how the two hoses are different?    Was it due to increased temperature and hydraulic pressure requirements?\nIs the inside diameter of the hose the same as the old hose, meaning will your brakes now apply equal pressure to both LF and RF wheels during an emergency stop?\nStarting in 2008, the Ford Escape’s turning radius increased over the previous models.  This directly affects the demands on the flexible brake hose.     Will your “older style” brake hose hold up under the increased turning radius that it was not designed to handle?\nIt cost Ford money to design and produce a replacement hose starting with the 2008 model.  They only spend money on things like that when they have to.   I would only substitute a replacement part if I were in the Ford engineering group during that redesign and knew the differences between the new and old hoses and why the newer one is required.",

Putting it up on a rack and getting the actual alignment values would help answer that.\nIn normal use, the tire slip is very minimal. There would need to be a large difference in load to create that difference. The heavier side would wear more than the light side. Think of FWD on a low power  car driven like grandma.

Ever since the service, and the truck is idling with the A/C or heat on, there’s a noticeable exhaust-like, oil-like smell in the cab. I never had this issue before the service, so something seems off.\nI went back to the shop that did the work, and they told me everything looks fine and suggested I just replace the cabin air filter. However, I’m skeptical because this smell started immediately after the service, and I never noticed it before.\nHas anyone experienced anything like this after a transmission fluid change or filter replacement? Could something have gone wrong during the service that’s causing this smell? Any insight or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\nThanks in advance!",

Any suggestions what it might be?\nStart with the battery terminals and the ground cable, IIRC, one of the battery cables grounds to a bell housing bolt, or more so a bolt with a stud on the head, with a group of other grounds, maybe even the ECM/TCM main grounds, close to the starter.. but don’t hold me to it… lol\nYou could also do a wiggle of the wiring harnesses over top of the trans while someone else is trying to start it…\nWhen you try to start the car, does the starter engage and you hear the rrr rrr noise or is it dead silent or what do you hear???..",

It is the real thing and will work as advertised eliminating mold, mildew and odors from your car.\nChlorine dioxide is dangerous at high concentrations, but the Auto Vaccine does not come close to those concentrations.  On the other hand, if you happen to notice a greenish/yellow cloud forming inside your car, you probably want to open the door and let it air out for a minute or two before getting in.\nAvantac Technologies and developed a method of using chlorine dioxide that is very easy to use.  Just pop the pouch in some water, close the door, and walk away.  After an hour or two, the job is done.  Be advised that chlorine dioxide will kill mold and mildew, but it is not a detergent.  If there is some mildew on the window sills, for example, you will still have to wipe the dead stuff off, but you can rest assured that it will be dead.\nI have used a similar product to eliminate mold and mildew and odor from several cars, and it has worked wonderfully.  I had to mix separate chemicals, then dilute and add to a spray bottle.  The Auto Guard system looks much easier to use.  Also, at the concentrations used, I have had no issues with bleaching rugs or seat fabric.\nChlorine dioxide also is effective in dealing with mold and mildew in basements, garages, and bathrooms.  Avantec offers different strength packets, but I don’t know how available they are for purchase.\nTom",

Turns out there was a leak, but having the windows up all of the time caused mold to grow in places it could not be cleaned out of.  For example, under the seats, under the carpet and padding, inside of all of the body panels and even in the seatbelt reels.\nThey and the dealer tried everything, including the chlorine dioxide, but the smell kept coming back.  Once the leak was fixed (shouldn’t be an issue with your car, just keep the windows down a few inches if you store it again, presumably in a garage or someplace water won’t get in) the entire interior was replaced.  New seats, carpet, panels, headliner, blower system, dashboard, EVERYTHING was replaced to keep the mold from coming back.

Shortly after buying it. chipmonks or mice got into the ducting from the inlet air snorkel. They were able to slip past the cabin filter to gain access to the cabin. After I realized what had happened, I evicted them, cleaned out the ducting and interior as best possible and afixed a screen over the inlet to prevent them returning.\nWarm, humid days were the worst for the residual smell. A distinct urine odor would permeate the interior on humid days and only get worse if it was hot outside. It was gradually dimishing with the emphasis on gradual.\nI ordered one of these Auto Vaccine “kits” on Sunday night and it was delivered in the mail on Tuesday. Amazing. Anyway, I followed the instructions and ran the fan on recirc for about an hour during the 4 hour treatment time. You could smell the gas some distance from the car so I knew it was working. It smells like an offbeat chlorine odor that takes some time to dissipate. It’s been about three weeks since I did the treatment and it smells like a brand new car. There is no hint of the prior smell and we’ve had a number of days were it would have been quite noticeable. It still smells slightly of the chlorine dioxide but it rapidly diminished to the point it pleasantly refreshing. I wouldn’t hesitate to use it again if the need arises. IMO, they delivered on their promise and I’m very happy with the result. YMMV.",

It’s like a waiting game. when the car shuts down, I already know the drill. to try my best to pull over on the side of the road. hazards on…then its a waiting game. because if at this point when i go to try and crank it after it has shut itself down there is no green key that pops in to blink at me i know it wont start up. it just cranks and cranks but wont turn over. so i sit some more then maybe 15 to 20 minutes later i turn the key once , twice then all lights come on and BAM! the green key blinks at me like 4 times goes off then im able to crank my van right on up.\nI do have all 3 honda original keys. I have changed the battery in the key fob. I will add this in…like 3 days after I purchased the van from a neighbor i misplaced my master key and key fob. shortly after that is when i started noticing odd behavior from my honda odyssey. like the back left sliding door would not allow me to control it, or passenger door wouldn’t lock by my driver conrols…odd little things like that. just wierd symptoms ya know. I remember a mercedes i had acting strange like that when i lost its key fob.\nabout a week ago a friend of mine asked me was i missing a set of keys, he had my keys i was super happy because by now the van has been shutting down on me. from my research and experience i was for sure the van would start back acting normal. but unfortunately this is not the case.\nhow can i tell if its the immobilizer? and its hard to believe i cant find anyone else that has had a honda with similar issues.

I did some research and figured I might have blown a fuse, I opened my fuse box under my hood and found out my 10 Amp ETCS fuse is blown. I changed the fuse and now acceleration is back, I can drive the car but I get this ‘VSC System Check’ error on my dash, the ‘Check Engine’ light is also on and the AC fan is not working.\nThe AC fuse was blown, I  tried swapping the fuse and it blew again as soon as I plugged it back in. Then I tried disconnecting the battery, waited 10 minutes, plugged the fuse in, connected the battery and it blew again. Then I tried swapping out the AC relay and changing the fuse and sadly it blew again. I am thinking it may be a bad AC blower, but it was working fine until the battery went dead.",

I’m presuming the second one.\nFrom what I see, assuming your car is configured w/ manual A/C, the 50 a htr fuse circuit  goes to the heater relay, then to the blower fan motor, then to the blower resistor, then to a control module.   Your shop will have to trace the circuit to see which of those is causing the short circuit.  They’d probably first try removing the heater relay and disconnect the fan blower motor, hoping that one of those is the culprit. the others will be more timing consuming  to diagnose.\nYou’ve got a bevy of codes and incomplete readiness monitors. The P2118 is the one I’d worry the most about, but it is possible that’s already solved as mentioned above. Hopefully the loss of communication between modules has resolved itself.  If not, that’s next in line.  There’s a weird one for the transmission,   start ability malfunction, a little worrying.  Given the list of problems, starting with the AC fuse blowing seems a reasonable place to start.\nfyi , a friend of mine with similar model year Corolla had a big problem getting the O2 sensor readiness monitor to complete, so suggest to keep a weather eye on that, as it could cause an emissions test failure.",

It looks significantly smaller but it is in and still working after 1/2 hour driving including a few start-ups.\nSince I first replaced the fuse and the new $25 fuse immediately blew the single blower motor link, I was thinking of a way to still be able to use it. My original fuse had 3 more 50 amp links in it and I used a dremel cut-off wheel to remove a link with a small tab from the original main bus strip and soldered it in place of the blown link. I have the hemostat where it is to absorb heat to keep it from melting the solder holding the link onto the contact. Bit fussy to get right and I messed with the first one too much and broke it. Fortunately there were two more. I had to grind a little bit of the blue plastic cover to fit the extra thickness, but it snapped together after that and a little super glue made up for a couple broken snap lock tabs.\n83996700e39795474928f79bc36a5c29ad96374a-1\n1920×2550 309 KB",

    "selftext": "I bought a pre-owned 2017 Jetta SE five years ago from Prestige Volkswagen. 2 years into having the car I got an EPC & Check Engine light. I called the dealer and they had me bring it in because it was still under warranty. They determined it was the turbo that needed to be replaced and so they kept the car for a few days while they worked on it. After they replaced it everything was fine, then months later almost exactly at that same year mark, I got the same codes again. I called the dealer again and they had me bring it in again. They said it was the turbo and that it needed to be replaced again. I left the car there a few days while they did the repair again and they said everything was good now. The car seemed to be running fine and then a year later, the codes came back up. Now the dealer says the car is out of warranty and I’d have to pay for it. I don’t want to pay for a repair that they clearly aren’t able to fix. This is the 3rd time in 3 years my turbo has gone bad. Is this a common problem for this car? Is there something else that could be causing the turbo codes to show, or that could be damaging the turbo? Any Ideas? Here are the codes I’m currently getting:\nP2564 - Turbocharger Boost Control Position Sensor A Circuit Low\nP056E - ISO/SAE\nP00AF - ISO/SAE\nP0300 - Random/Multiple Cylinder Misfire\nP0301 - Cylinder 1 Misfire Detected\nP00AF - ISO/SAE\nP0303 - Cylinder 3 Misfire Detected",

In the initial post you just referred to “sliders” - which I took to be the guide pins/caliper mounting bolts. (The ones inside of the rubber boots that allow the caliper to move).

The designs of course are tested, but even if owner follows the maintenance requirements exactly, impossible to test for 6 years of use.\nOne common mistake owners make btw is using the wrong maintenance schedule.  Most owners should use the “severe” schedule, b/c they do a lot of short drives in their car, take kids to soccer practice, buy groceries,  etc, rather than mostly  long freeway drives.  I often see my neighbors leave, come back 15 minutes later,  their normal drive cycle. If that is what is needed for family use for the car, ok, but that sort of drive-cycle is very hard on a car engine, requiring the severe-maintenance schedule.\nWhen you purchased your Edge, what did Consumer Reports say about it,  based on prior model-year repair history?\nAs a reference point, I own a 50 year old Ford truck, original engine.",

If there’s no coolant in the oil, and you have confirmed this by draining out the oil, then I’d leave the motor in-place and repair/replace the heads.  If there’s any coolant in the oil, there’s a risk that even if you fix the top-end, the bearings will go bad in the near future.  This risk can be reduced, but not eliminated, if you pull the oil pan and clean the inside of the oil pan, pull and clean the oil pick-up tube, etc.\nIf there’s any coolant in the oil, it is probably cheaper to find a working used engine.  By the time you pay for machine shop labor to recondition the heads, a new gasket set, new head bolts, new timing set, new water pump, etc, it’s not much cheaper than a working used motor.  Even worse, you could pay all these costs, put it back together, and still end up with a spun bearing, knock, or timing chain problems.",

Opened the oil cap whille it was running and a lot of air and mist was shooting up. was wondering if anyone has tried soaking the pistons in b12 or something as I’ve heard that might help unclog the pistons.

If you don’t have air in the brake system, then you flush to replace the old brake fluid.\nIf you want to flush the system, then use old water or juice bottles, drill a hole in the caps and get some clear tubing that fits over the bleed valve and into the hole in the bottle cap.  Open the bleed valves, one at a time or all four, but if you do all four, it is best to have a friend standing over the master cylinder to keep that reservoir full.  Close each bleeder as the fluid starts running clear.\nOrder doesn’t matter if you do all four at once.  If the master cylinder goes dry, then you will have to bleed.  This will not clean out the old fluid from the ABS, but there isn’t much in there and it will eventually circulate back into the system.  That small amount of old fluid will not do any harm to the system as long as you follow the brake flush schedule.",

I live in Spain and talking with mechanics is a challenge because I don’t know the names of all the car parts in Catalan (I live in Catalonia, Spain). They replaced something that had to do with the transmission, some bar that goes across the car. I don’t know what it is or what it is called, but it took over three weeks to get the part. That seemed to lessen the noise, but I still hear it. So I took it back today and asked that they check the tires (which are new), the lug nuts, which would be the simplest. If that doesn’t do it, I suppose they will look into other possibilities. I wondered why doing what they did decreased the noise, but didn’t eliminate it. Oh well.

I took it in to a vw dealership thinking it was a vacuum leak, they checked it out thoroughly, drove it a bunch, hooked it up to the computer, looked for error codes, the whole shebang. They said everything was fine and they didn’t know what could’ve caused it. I took my car home, but I swear it’s not quite right, acceleration feels weird, sometimes feels too slow to get going or too fast to get going, touchy in general.\nCome today, I’m on my way to work, idling at a red light and the lurching thing happens again, only this time the RPM spike is little more drastic. It literally felt like my car was going to accelerate through the brake? Cue throwing the car into park and turning on my hazards in an inconvenient spot. Lurching still happens in park, I shut my engine off, give it about a minute, turn it back on, goes right to essentially accelerating on its own again. Turned it off again, waited 30 minutes or so in hopes cooling down would help, it does, and I was able to start it up and get it home. Again it didn’t feel normal, gas still either felt too touchy or laggy and I don’t dare drive on this problem in traffic.\nAnyone got any ideas?",

They did not give me a diagnostic of my car either like the places I am accustomed to going.\nI got home and checked everything as I was smelling a odd smell. Everything appeared normal except the oil seemed a bit full to me. Next day we noticed drips in the driveway. We went under the car and it was dripping from the chassis in 5 places. I took it back to the shop and explained to them it has never dripped oil before please help. They admitted the filter was “a bit crooked” but then they tried to tell me I had a “rear main seal leak” and show me a picture. I asked them if they could please help me wipe up all the spilled oil from the filter being in crooked. We checked the car when we got home they clearly didn’t wipe anything up. I ended up wiping it all up myself. There doesn’t appear to be any more drips and it appears all the drips were from the filter being crooked. I had never seen a drip on the driveway before I took the car to them. I have taken photos of the dip stick, the driveway and under the car. I do not have a ton of money to spare. Should I take the car into another mechanic to double check? The oil change place does not seem to care and I have already submitted a complaint. What would you do in my situation?",

In many vehicles, if you try to add the oil too fast, it backs up and spills out the oil fill tube.  I’m going to guess that is how the oil got spilled onto the engine.\nBecause the lowest point on the engine is usually near the back at the bottom of the oil pan, the rear main seal usually gets the blame.  Fifty years ago, rear main seals were unreliable and often leaked, but not so much today.  Back then the rear main seals were made from a piece of rope.  Today they are rubber.",

It wasn’t that bad if it isn’t for the fact that the frame where the suspensions are located got bent during the crash. It’s not really that much, but at the same time it kinda is annoying. Take in consideration that the car is lifted only on one side and so the angle is a little exaggerated, but still it gives you the idea. Is it feasible to fix this? I am not a professional, i do this cause i like it, but i don’t have all the tools for this, in this case the hydraulic press. I tried every way possible, doing leverage, but of course nothing happens.\nAre there any option that i could try? asking for a mechanic is the last option.\nIs it safe if i leave it like that?\nThank you!",

The biggest issue is finding a way to bend the sections back without whatever you’re holding bending instead. This is why frame jigs are helpful. That being said, I have brute forced stuff back into place before. If you push against something else to move the strut support, you have to be careful whatever you’re using as an anchor point doesn’t move backward instead. Pulling may be more effective. You have more ways to anchor the rest of the car and pull the tower back out. You will have to go past the point you want it to end up as it will relax a bit when tension is removed.\nRecently, while on vacation, my wife managed to jackknife the boat trailer and bend the tongue at 30 degrees or more. What to do with limited resources and no way to drive the trailer any appreciable distance? Like Mustangman suggested, found two trees close enough together, put the tongue between them and dragged the back of the trailer over to bend it back.

    "selftext": "Hello, i have already wrote here before about my car. Audi a3 2010 1.6TDI 105HP 7 speed automatic. Once winter started i had a problem that when i start the car cold, rpm scale would go up and down and car would begin to choke and shut off. This could be solved by me slamming on my gas pedal for a few sec that would give car a boost to stay on and be stable. This however didn’t work for long as another symptom would appear soon, this time once i pressed the gas pedal it did nothing, and as i couldn’t boost the car it would shut off. Only on my 6-7 attempt to start the car would gas pedal start to work. I thought this was problematic and would take a look at it but another symptom appeared. I was driving my car and once i went over a hill my gas pedal stopped working. I had to re start the car for it to work again. And this continued to happen every time i would go across speed bumps or randomly as i was driving, gas pedal would stop working for a few secounds.\nI decided i had enough and i gave a car to a mechanic. He said it was probably bad fuel injectors and he took them out and sent them to be re wired( don’t know the exact word in english but he sent them to a guy who checks them out, if they can be repaired he does it and sends them back) that cost me 600e, and the guy who was repairing them said they were in very very bad shape, one of them was so bad it was injecting live fuel. I gave another 100e to mechanic for his work and he also replaced injector holders or caps i think.\nProblem solved? No! A few days pass, car is normal, i drove it in clear road with high rpm to clear out any bad fuel that might of left from injectors before they were fixed. Than to my suprise one morning i start the car, RPM go wild, pointer jumps up and down as car struggles to stay on, gas pedal is not working, and than it shuts off, only on my 9-10 attempt gas pedal starts working and i get the car to stay on. I must say i didn’t expiriance gas pedal shutting off while driving yet, but this is insane. I called my mechanic and as i explained to him that my parking is a little bit steep, its like 5-7cm angle, and i always park the car front first, he said fuel might be leaking back from motor to the back so thats why i have trouble starting it untill the fuel reaches the motor. And he told me i should park the car other way around so that front is pointing downhill. I’m now going to wait 3-5 days and see if that does anything. Anyone has advice?",

Dealer did say robot that was shifting gears was messed up when he bought it from a owner, and he fixed it before selling it to me. After that overheating problem i had that was happening because coolant was too old and it clogged up some pipes, i suspected the car might of been sitting unused for quite some time( maybe even years) before dealer got bought it, and as i heard its worse for a car to not be driven for a long time than to be driven badly xD.\nAlso i would like to add that diagnostic is clean with no faults, and if it means anything my fuel consumption is 7.5l/100km. I don’t think this is very good considering before this car i owned Golf MK 5, 2.0 TDI 140HP automatic that had fuel consumption of about 5.5l/100km.

I put the battery charger on it (set to the 10amp setting) and after several hours of charging it started (I tried after 10 minutes, but it again behaved like it had at the grocery store). Once the battery was charged and the car started I took it to two different auto parts stores.  They both tested the battery, alternator, and starter and reported all was well.

I have ordered a battery maintainer as suggested and will install it permanently under the hood so we just have to plug it into 110vac when parked in the garage.  I also got a device that plugs into the cigarette lighter outlet that displays the system voltage.  As expected, most of the time while driving around it reads 14.1v regardless of speed or engine RPM, however, it will sometimes drop down to as low as 12.5v! This happened both while driving, as well as at stop lights (but not at every stop light at which I stopped).  The times it did happen at a light it took several seconds after stopping for the voltage to drop, and it took several seconds after starting to accelerate for the voltage to return to 14.1v.  I am guessing that this indicates that the alternator is intermittently failing, or the belt is slipping. Unfortunately, I have been unable to duplicate the problem while parked in my garage where I could observe if the belt was slipping.",

Time will tell if this is the solution to the original problem (battery becoming discharged over time to the extent that the vehicle will not start). Also, I read a little about the Dual Mode Charging System after you mentioned it, and I am not sure that it is working in my vehicle.  For one, for low output mode, the intake air temperature must be above 68 degrees F, and the ambient temperature today when this was happening was 47.  Also, shouldn’t the low output mode generally be on for more than a few seconds at a time under normal operating conditions?",

But removing the heads will reveal this.  Don’t teardown the block if you don’t need to.\nIf you do need to replace the rings and the block still shows a good cross hatch pattern from the factory honing, you may be able to get away with a 600 grit diamond hone of the cylinder walls.  This just removes the tops of the peaks of the old honing process and will allow the new rings to seat quickly.\nYou will need to consult with a certified BMW mechanic on this.  They may also be able to do the acid etch in the shop to expose the silicon crystals if needed.  BTW silicone is the rubber sealant, silicon is a hard metal.",

I’ll apply gas, the tachometer will jump in response, but I get almost no power at all and maintain a speed as if I were just coasting and not applying any gas at all. No indicator lights shine on the dash when this happens. I thought maybe it was traction control on the edge of being activated (I’m grasping at straws), pulled over, turned that off but the car continued to drive in the same, silly way. Ill park the car and come back to it a day later when the weather is better and it runs like nothing happened.\nWhen the issue first presented itself I thought the tranmission was slipping and took it to a tranmission mechanic. He ran diagnostics but it was completely clean. He flushed the transmission but found no clues in the fluid. He does not think it is a transmission issue.\nI then took the car to a general mechanic. They said I needed new tires and it was the tires slipping. I urged them that I don’t think that’s what it was and that I know what slipping feels like. He said it might be the spark plugs. I don’t think he actually inspected the car as he only charged me for parts and the maintenance itself (which I am very upset about, but that’s for another day). That said, I’m not a mechanic so who am I to question them. I bought all new tires, I needed them anyway, and my spark plugs were changed. The issue persists.\nA friend of mine has an ODB2 reader and the car still doesn’t code. I’ve also tried spraying water onto the spark plugs to see if there would be an arc (per youtube) but came up with nothing.\nPlease help me. I’m at my whits end after 2 mechanics. The car is still so low mileage I have a hard time trying to reconile buying a new vehicle when I don’t know if it’s just a cheap fix or not.",

    "selftext": "In Nov of 2024 I bought a 2018 Ford fusion Titanium Hybrid from a car dealership in St Louis. That evening on the way there it started snowing. After buying the car as I got on the highway the readend began swaying left to right. Even tho it was snowing and the roads were real bad I could tell there was definitely something wrong with the car. Because I had yet to get insurance on the car I decided to park it at a gas station and come back for it once the roads were clear. I called the salesman immediately and told him something was seriously wrong with the car. He told me not to worry there was nothing wrong with the car and said it must have just been the roads and promised it would pass inspection. Once I came back to pick the car back to pick the car up, two days later, I immediately drove it to Dobbs and had them inspect it. Just as I had thought, they told me it failed the inspection because of one bad front tire and the sway bar right away bar link was broke. The dealership had me drop the car off and he took it to his shop and repaired not only the right sway bar link but also the left one. He put a set of two new tires on the front. Thinking the issue was resolved I took it for reinspection where they stated the links had not been replaced. All while the dealer was promising me they had. I decided to drop the car back to where I live, an hour and a half away, and have it looked at by a different company. They stated that the links had, in deed, been replaced however whoever replaced them didn’t tighten them down all the way so they went ahead and did so, free of charge. They gave me a quote for two new tires for the rear of the car that the dealership agreed to also pay for and I decided to take it to get inspected by a different inspector locally. It passed inspection. I have noticed that the car rides kinda rough. When the rear tires hit a bump at speeds over 30 mph the car jumps real fast from one side to the other like the rear end in gotta kick out from underneath me. Well he haven’t had any snow again until the last couple of days. When I went to town two days ago about 12 hour after the snowfall quit. The roads were still horrible. I was caught off guard when the car began swaying in the (swerving) rear REAL bad. I realized the this is the same feeling, only intensified, that I feel when it’s raining and the ground is wet. It literally shakes the whole car and it physically feels like the hops to one side or the other and then feels like it’s going to kick out from underneath itself and cause me to spin out of control. While the roads are dry, if I drive through a large puddle of water that’s coming from nearby melting snow piles, the whole car will begen swaying relentlessly until I get passed the puddle and it goes back to driving normal. The alignment is perfect on the car as it doesn’t pull, even the slightest, when I let go of the wheel while driving. Everything else is perfect on the car. I rides and drives like a brand new car until we hit water or snow on the roadways. I decided to pay for a Carfax which states the car has been in 2 minor accidents, the last one being over a year prior to the previous owner selling the car. I would had to have to sell it and take a loss on it as it’s a very nice car despite the issues I’m having. I’ve talked to a few mechanics/friends who are unable to give me any answers as to what else could be causing this issue. That is why I’m here. If anyone has any information they can share to help me properly diagnose is swaying issue, it would be super wonderful helpful and I would be greatly appreciated. I’m at my wits end and really need to get this resolved  . I do not mind putting a little money into this car to have it operate properly, I just need to first be able to figure out the real issue causing the problem. I would greatly appreciate anyone who has any idea what the problem is.\nThanks\n-Bishop",

I did the oil change today (it was fresh when I got it) and want to replace the plugs, not that theres any evidence it needs it but just to get it out of the way in case and I want an excuse to get acquainted some more with it. Are the NGK laser iridium plugs a good choice for this? I also picked up some genuine mazda M-3 ATF from the dealership for my power steering since I was in there asking about something else and it was only $10. Their coolant however was $30 so I went to walmart and got this coolant for $12. The manual says FL22 but this seems to match up with their OEM fluid in everything but the dilution which was 55/45 which I’m sure isn’t a big deal. It says it meets the standards of ASTM D3306 and JIS K2234. This the right fluid?\ncoolant\n612×911 105 KB",

The paint was scratched all over and it had started to loosen up in some of the corners. I decided to repaint it in its original black color (I don’t know the exact name of the color). I’m aware that repainting the car might make it’s value decrease but I don’t mind since I’m not planning on selling it (and I bought the car really cheap).\nThe paint job was done in 2020 and now 5 years later I might need to paint it again. In October (4 days before it was time for winter storage) someone decided to take a ”stroll” all over the car. The person who did it must have had big boots with gravel stuck beneath them since it deeply scratched the whole car. The car got deep scratches all the way from the emblem to the back end of the roof. I’ve tried to fix it by polishing it but it didn’t help at all.\nI’ve decided to repaint it once again… sigh… But this time I’ve been thinking of doing it in a new color. I would love to hear your opinions on what color combination that you think would look good with the interior, rims, breaks, etc. I’m not repainting it myself, my friend owns a really good paint shop that helps me for a fraction of the price (so the result is gonna look professional).\nLooking forward to be hearing from you!\nIMG_2955\n4032×3024 1.5 MB\nIMG_2956\n1179×881 294 KB",

The starter motor can produce a lot of torque on the motor. It can easily break rings that are stuck. Especially older brittle ones. After this long, it is a better choice to use hand power to try and rotate the engine before attempting to start it. As mentioned, plugs out, oil in, rest to soak and then use a breaker bar on the crank to try and slowly rotate the engine by hand.\nIf you break rings attempting to start it, it may not be immediately obvious but you’ll know pretty soon thereafter…",

After a few miles there was also a p0012 or P0014 for camshaft timing. A new crankshaft position sensor fixed the first code, but the second codes have been persistent.\nChanging the oil seemed to make the codes appear slower for a little while. But this didn’t last long. Replacing the OCV’s had no effect.\nAnother, more concerning thing is a noise that developed simultaneously. It  sounded at first almost like a fan or a CD player that was tapping while spinning. It sounded like it was coming from the middle of the dash (which is I guess where bank 1 is, behind the dash). It began to happen predictably whenever I punched the accelerator, and for a longer period, like a few seconds. It may have become a little louder.\nI found a YT video of what may be the sound, but that car is idling. There is a single comment below it that says “replace timing belt tensioner ASAP”. I also went to a Japanese specialist and the guy at the counter suggested it may be the timing chain based on what I told him.\nSomeone on reddit thought it was an oil pressure issue, and to check the oil pressure and maybe drop the pan. I’ve been suspecting the whole time that something may have gotten inside the engine and obstructed the oil flow. It is not in the oil filter or the VVT filter. I want to drop the pan but I’d also have to remove or partially remove the exhaust Y pipe.\nTo summarise, I have persistent p0012 and P0014 codes for camshaft B advanced and Camshaft A retarded. I am also having a sound after I accelerate moderately that a lasts a few seconds or until I let off the pedal\nThe youtube video with a similar noise.

Bone stock.\nProblem:\nWhen I am accelerating in any gear my car will take extra long to get over 2500 rpms, the higher the gear the longer it takes. But I have had it take longer in lower gears that in a higher one.\nBackground:\nThe first time I noticed the problem I was driving on the freeway and when I was accelerating I noticed my car wouldn’t go over 55mph. I didn’t think to look at the rpms so i thought it was something entirely different. (Pretty sure it was) A few days later my car engine dies going 35 on the street. I take it to a mechanic and he replaced the spark plugs for 500$? anyway I didn’t notice at first but my car would take absurdly long to get over 2500 rpms in gears 4 and 5. even when i floor it it takes up to 10 seconds. Before 2500 rpms it accelerates slower than a new car but not slow enough to get people honking and swerving around you. And after 2500 rpms when I get sick of it, its super fast, makes a high pitched whirring noise, but I think that’s the v-tec.\nI looked everywhere for any car not just a Honda civic to see if they had the same problem. I couldn’t find anything even closely related.\nAlso the car probably also took long to get over 2500 rpms before I took it to the mechanic but lately its really bad, I was a while ago I got the spark plugs to I’m not sure what could be wrong, and if there is a way to repair it.\nThe only mods I have seen on the car is the thing at the back of the exhaust is not there. I think it just makes the engine sound louder but correct me if I am wrong. It’s not open heads its just the large oval thing at the very end of the exhaust.\nlmk if you need anymore info, probably check this later tonight and tmmr, thanks.",

I had my wife get in the driver’s seat and try to start it while I wiggled the wiring harness at the transmission range sensor, etc.  Since I heard the fuel injectors firing on each unsuccessful starting attempt, I removed the fuel pump relay to avoid dumping fuel into the engine.\nI have the factory service manual, so I referred to the troubleshooting steps which they give under “no crank”.  However, once I got to step 31 under Engine Electrical 1E-7, I could not find where exactly connector C104 is on the vehicle.  I surmised that it is one of the connectors on the PCM, however nowhere are those connectors labeled.  The PCM is located under the front passenger seat, and they suggest removing the seat to access it.\nI found that the neutral safety switch (pins G and E on the transmission range sensor) were closed as expected, and the old and new range sensor both tested ok.  I did not have the control voltage to the starter to engage the relay.\nSince I could not figure out the location of several of the connectors which the FSM said to check, I started taking off interior panels to check for loose or damaged wiring.  I pulled off the plastic casing around the steering column, the knee bolster, the center console, but wiggling the connectors and wires made not difference trying to start.\nEventually, I moved the front passenger seat all the way forward, reached under the plastic splash shield on top of the PCM, and pushed on the blue connector.  Then I was able to crank the engine.  I surmise that there is either something wrong with this connector or a cracked solder joint in the PCM.\nAny ideas on what to do next?",

It is somewhat of a pain to lift each corner, and place a wheel under the tire.  When the weather is warmer, I will have to do that, in order to get underneath and see what exactly is going on.\ndb4690:\nDo you even have the wiring diagram for the ignition switch and starter?\nYes, I have the factory service manual for this car.  I have studied the schematic, and sadly it’s clear as mud.  The problem is that connectors are labeled with a number, such as PL102, but it’s not clear where some of these are physically located in the car.",

The FSM’s I’ve used have always included  a “location” section, which narrows down  where each connector is located, usually with a diagram what the connector looks like.\nThe reason the diagram is confusing I expect is b/d it is one diagram shows more than one configuration.

Long story short replacing the radiator myself I twisted off part of the transmission line going to the radiator during the install so I used a high pressure hose with x2 hose clamps to tie back into the existing line. Couple months went by coming home from work rpms were going higher but I wasn’t going any faster, lost all power then realized the hose clamp came loose and I lost all fluid. Overfilled the fluid without realizing or knowing how to check properly then the truck was only able to hit 15mph soon as it reaches 15mph it slips bad as if I slammed on the brakes hard. Drained some fluid out and now I’m able to hit about 18-20mph before running into the same issue but the dipstick is reading a normal level of fluid. The answer sounds obvious I have to replace the transmission but was curious if there’s an alternative and was curious what went wrong/what was damaged when I lost the fluid. Any help/suggestions would be appreciated thanks for reading.",

I’ve recently replaced the ICM, and the wire that signals the ICM from the 3x crank sensor. Also noticed a vac line that goes from the bottom of the throttle body to the rear valve cover came off, so I put that back on and it did nothing. Was also looking at a throttle position sensor, as I unplugged it and it didn’t seem to change the amount of throttle response at all, it was still terrible and running on half the engine. When it cranks, it kinda fires off and on, like it really wants to start but can’t. I’ve verified strong spark by shocking the holy cow out of myself taking the plugs off the coils, but I didn’t have good diag tools (like fuel pressure tester or scanner) with me at the moment. Just poking my head around, seeing if anyone is a century wizard and has a fix for this problem before I head 30 miles out to diag this POS on the side of the road.",

I managed to get it to start working and I made it home thankfully, when I parked and turned off the car it went completly dead, tried firing it up and I got 0 power. Not even to my lights.\nSo the next day I cleaned my terminals a little bit, reconnected the wires and got power to everything and it cranked over fine, until the next day, started doing the same thing. So I figured it was my battery, changed my battery out reconnected and I’m still having the issue. This time when I cranked the car, it cranked about 8 or 9 times and then my dash went completely dead again. Reconnected the terminal wires, got breif power, one crank and boom 0 power again.\nAnyone got any ideas? I’m thinking maybe the connectors are dirty near the fire wall, correct me if I’m wrong but those can get dirty and corroded right? My brain is thinking it’s the positive terminal wire as well. I’m gonna try to use baking soda, mix it with water to make a paste. Rub it on there.\nWould a dirty terminal connector indeed cause this?

If you have a fuel pressure gauge, slap it on there and look at what’s happening both while it’s running and on a hot shut-down.\nAnother thought is that the no-start hot is an ignition issue and the wonky idle is…well, any number of other things but vacuum leaks (P0171) do come to mind.  Visual and aural checks can only take you so far.  Maybe carefully feed something flammable around the intake and other vacuum connections looking for a reaction.

The high and fluctuating idle is from the time the engine is started cold to the time the engine is shut down either cold or hot. The engine will start only after it has cooled to a certain point, but it does not have to be fully cooled. It seems that between 20 and 40 minutes after shut down the engine will start again. It varies. I should edit the original post to read that this condition is intermittent, meaning it will sometimes start when hot.\nA fuel pressure test and either a smoke test or propane torch to test for vacuum leaks is definitely in order.

If it doesn’t hold pressure, the fuel in the lines can vaporize and shoot fumes instead of liquid fuel.  (Sort of like the old problem of vapor lock). One simple way to check is to prime it up before starting - turn the key to the run position (without cranking) and back off a few times, and then crank it.

My manual says “The coolant is correct when the upper end of the red float is at least even with the upper edge of the filler neck, but no more than .8 inches above it - that is, up to the second mark on the float.” My mechanic told me if you overfill the coolant system it will just spit out the excess coolant like a baby drinking beer… Every 3 months my car’s coolant level goes from max of the float to min of the float and I’ve been topping it off with a cup of coolant/water to bring back to max. So the question is do I have leak or is the coolant system getting rid of excess coolant to bring the float back to min?\nAlso another question… how bad is it to overfill the coolant system by a little bit?\nMy car is a 2002 BMW 330Ci.\nThanks!",

If you can’t see a leak, it might be a leaking head gasket letting it go out the exhaust.",

If so, look in that area.\nOne last thought. If they are not under the seat, I would bet that they are not even in the car, but somewhere on the outside of the car but close enough that the vehicle thinks it is in the car. so, look all around the car. I have done that a few times when fiddling around with the car in the garage.",

The inner diameter of the drum is about 225-230mm and maximum says 221 so I know that’s bad. I checked both back wheels for play and there’s none at all.\nSpinning them is what made me pretty sure it’s the wheel bearings (videos of the left and right included) but I’m confused because everyone says the sound should get worse at higher speeds and be consistent.

But what exactly is high-mileage motor oil, and how does it benefit your aging engine? Let’s dive into the details.\nOil for high mileage is a type of motor oil made for older cars—typically those with over 75,000 miles. It has extra ingredients that help keep aging engines running smoothly, such as:\nSeal Conditioners:\nThese chemicals revitalize and maintain the elasticity of engine seals, resulting in fewer leaks.\nExtra Detergents:\nThese additives help keep the engine clean by\npreventing sludge\nand deposits from accumulating.\nAnti-wear Agents:\nThese compounds provide additional protection against wear, which can be more pronounced in older engines.\nViscosity Modifiers:\nThese aid in maintaining correct oil thickness at different temperatures, resulting in better lubrication.\nFriction Modifiers:\nThese additives minimize friction between moving parts, which increases engine efficiency and performance.\nHigh mileage oil exemplifies breakthroughs in automotive science. It provides a personalized solution for individuals looking to conserve and safeguard their car assets.\nTester",

This could be nothing or could be a sign of real trouble coming.  Mostly it is just the seal on the cap is dirty and allowing some moisture to get into the area, cleaning the seal will solve the problem.  Worst case is a blown head gasket or worn out rings.

Definitely plenty of gas, though now that I think of it, the first abrupt halt in engine performance two years ago came just after I put low octane “Regular” in the tank at a station whose gas tanks were drained low. Now after thinking about it, I’m wondering if low quality gas, maybe dirty, might be a factor here. Due to finances, I recently quit relying solely on mid octane or high test gas which I had relied upon after getting the car going last time. Maybe that’s a stretch, but your advice on tapping the gas filter is on point. I have wondered if there might have occurred some blockage in the filter sufficient to suddenly block glow altogether.\nThank you. More later.",

You have to really press down hard on the tabs at the three connection points, as I’m sure you know, and then also use a little elbow grease even still.

        "body": "Busta:\nQuestion: Do you know how that might show up on my code reader?\nInsufficient fuel flow/pressure  might show up in the real-time fuel trim data.  The powertrain knows how much fuel is injected (for a properly working injector)  for a given injector pulse width (time).  The powertrain computer calculates the injector pulse width based upon several inputs, the main one being the measured airflow into the engine.  If the injector is injecting less fuel than it should, that will confuse the powertrain computer.    This problem seems unlikely to be caused by the fuel filter b/c it is happening at idle rpm.  Fuel filter problems tend to show up more in high fuel flow driving situations, going uphill fast, etc.   But a faulty fuel filter might cause this, and since you want to install a new one anyway, seems as good of time as any.  I’ve never had to deal with those tricky fuel filter connections myself. But I can certainly understand they’d be even more tricky in super cold weather.  One caution,  be sure to follow all the common gasoline safety precautions.\nDisclaimer:  I’m just a knucklehead diy’r opinion, no 03 Exped experience.",

        "body": "OK, my sincere thanks to all of you for your interest and comments on my 2003 Ford Ex. I also apologize for my delayed responses and updates. Three kids in and out of school and temps in the teens stopped my shade tree DIY cold.\nAny further interest and input will be PROFOUNDLY appreciated.\nCurrent status then some (possibly) relevant context:\nNew fuel filter in place.\nFuel rail pressure reads Zero. Nada. None with car key switched on.\nStill nothing after cranking with starter fluid. (Here the car cranked right up and ran for quite a bit longer than I’d expected with just a fairly hefty one shot of starter fluid PRIOR to key ignition. And activating my foot pedal to throttle up seemed to work at first, but soon car died. Won’t crank or run without starter fluid).\nI don’t know if it matters at all, but some history here: The combination of injector cleaner and starter fluid definitely served well one year back when I jerry-rigged a fuel pump relay bypass to get the car running again after it had sat for two years. It then ran hardly at all, then roughly, then well after repeated treatments with Sea Foam and/or Berrymans injector cleaner and starter fluid. Ran well all year on my admittedly jack-leg one wire by pass at the fuse box.\nWhen it quit this time, at least two weeks ago, it quit suddenly when I cranked it–fired strongly as it always does, then 1/2 second later engine fabruptly stopped dead. And I do think I heard it MAYBE make a clicking noise at the fuse box when it went out. I first thought maybe my by-pass wiring disconnected. I double checked that plus checked relay fuses at the box, OK.\nHowever, I have not checked all possible relevant fuses in the box. Is it possible something else went out for another relay or connector switch that might interfere with power to the pump or interfere with gas transfer after the pump turns on.\nMaybe I did not have my by-pass re-route properly grounded and thus eventually tripped or blew out something in the power line to or at the pump. Or blew out the pump itself. Maybe the pump just flat out died.\nOne more relevant context note here: The whirring, running noise I still hear coming up from my back right quarter panel area when I turn key on–I had assumed that that was the fuel pump pre-start function. Runs two/three seconds. Stops. I usually repeat the key on pre-start process in effort to ensure SOME gas flow.\nSo I don’t know what is coming on back there if it’s not the fuel pump.\nAs a test, I even disconnected my fuel pump relay wire at the box and then switched key on. Whirring run noise still coming on short while, then dying. So at this point, I’m basically lost in the cosmos.\nI have not yet followed up on the no pressure reading with the multi-meter that is included in my loaner pressure gauge kit. That’s tomorrow.\nHonestly I don’t know where to start with the multi-meter, not even what setting to use on it. I’m attached a photo of the multi-meter face–any advice on what setting to use or what circuits to test, in what order–MUCH appreciated. (Here’s where my tenderfoot greenhorn ignorance really shouts out loud!)\nThere is a good '03 Ford Ex YT video that includes what to test where, and when. I’ll find that again as well.\nSorry for the novella here. But with advice I’m getting here plus YT stuff, I’m taking baby diagnostic steps.\nThanks again to you all!\n(attachments)\n20250123_220823.jpg\n1800×3449 1.15 MB",

The plastic bottle fit snugly into the intake hose disconnected from the air filter housing and the hose clamp grabbed firmly. The fitting on the intake end of this contraption accepts a hose from the compressor. An open/close valve allows fine tuning of the airflow. Compressor was set to about 5-7psi. After hooking it up, lighting the incense with a propane torch, running it for a few minutes without seeing any smoke I pulled a vacuum line and smoke came pouring out, so I know it works. After running it long enough to assure myself that there were no leaks I shut the valve and turned off the compressor. With no fresh air coming in the incense stopped burning, ready for the next test.\nThe incense can be soaked in baby oil, but probably not necessary.

I decided to get 2 used rims from the junk yard(without tires) with the intention of getting rid of my spare donut, replacing it with a full size spare.\nWithin a few months, one of the rims that I believe was from the junk yard deflated in my trunk…\nI noticed this actually in 2021 and kind of forgot some details(Cant look at the work order since its in my storage unit and I’m on active duty right now) and have been negligent over the last 4 years with remedying it, so this tire has also been sitting in my trunk for 4 years deflated as well…\nAnyway, apart from the lecture I should get about not fixing this sooner and driving around without a spare my question is this.\nWhat is this yellow residue around the rim? I assume it’s some sort of paint to detect a leak, and if so, having it all around the rim does that mean it was a violent deflate?\nThe tire wasn’t under load since it was in my trunk, is that at all related to my issue? Am I SUPPOSED to have a donut instead of a full size for a corolla?\nWhat are the possible causes of this, Slow leak? Poor mount install of the tire? Bad rim? Bad Tire?\nSince it’s been sitting in my trunk for 4 years, does it look dry rotted?\nGoing forward, should I have a tire place A. Remount the same tire on the same rim, B. Replace the rim, C. Replace the tire/New tire. D. Something else.\nAnyway, Thank you for your time!\n20250204_142312\n1920×2560 987 KB\n20250204_142218\n1920×1440 515 KB\n20250204_142319\n1920×1440 510 KB",

He also replaced the Fuel pump relay. Once again he received the parts from Autozone. He charged me for that labor upwards of ~$200. Anyway, like clockwork it’s been about 7-9 months since then and today I tried to start my car and it did the exact same things that occurred the last 2 times my car died due to the fuelpump, when I turn the key the starter works, but chugs and dies. It sounds starved for fuel.\nSo yes in theory this third failure hasn’t been confirmed yet by a certified professional but I’m betting all in that it’s the fuel pump again, to clarify my inquiry isn’t about diagnosing if it is for sure the fuel pump, my inquiry is in the likely event that it is the fuel pump again, what could cause a fuel pump to die 3 times in 2 years even after a fuel pump relay has been replaced.\nBefore I take it in to the same mechanic I just wanted to understand what I’m dealing with here.\nFrom what I understand right now from your post it’s possible that the mechanic has bought some cheap parts and maybe he’s being shady not covering labor in the warranty?\nThe list I have right now from yourself and other’s replies…\nMileage\nSand/Grit in gasoline\nRunning engine with near empty gas tank\ncheap parts\nFuel pump relay\nfuel pump filter\nelectric wire connections\nNow that I’ve clarified a bit, is there anything that I can add to this list?\nOnce again thank you for helping",

When the fuel indicator turns on I go and get gas though and fill it up to full.\nHowever, I will say I have owned this car since 2016, I’d drive 30 minute round trips for work up until 2020. From 02/2020-10/2020 I was driving an hour round trip every day for work + doing frequent ~5 hr round drives once a week, the habit of waiting til empty during this period was noticeably more regular because I like to fuel up either near my starting point or near my end point, so I was pushing my car on E during this period. The original fuel pump died 04/24/2020, the replacement died 11/21/2020(7 months), if it’s the fuel pump again then the replacement to the replacement lasted 9 months. From 10/2020-Current I have been driving just 30 minute round trips for work again a day, so this fuel pump that lasted 9 months was treated with care as it wasnt being punished with extensive long distance missions on empty, So back to the normal routine in which the first pump lasted for years doing the same thing I’ve done in which it lasted for 4 years since I bought the car without issues, very frustrating issue",

When the RPM is close to 1500, it starts vibrating. The vibration is not too much but also not too less. Once I am above or below this RPM, it runs fine. Also, I notices a humming sound around 110kph which goes away if I move to 120 or 130. I can feel the vibration in steering and gas pedal but not too much in the seat. The sound seems to come from the left side of the car (driver side).\nSo far, we have checked ball bearings and changed one on left side. Changed the lever arm on left side. Checked all the engine mounts and changed one. Did the wheel balancing. Checked axle and basically everything that we can think of but the vibration is still there. The changing of engine mount maybe have moved it to more like in the range of 1300rpm.\nOne mechanic told me that the shocks on the front left side are softer than the one on the front right side but the other one disagreed. I will change the transmission fluid today.\nNow I am out of ideas, please advise if anyone have faced the same issue or have some leads to fix the issue as its making me miserable to not able to find the problem.\nThanks,",

She desperately needed a vehicle and it was still running at the time. (2004 chevy classic, 280k)\nSeveral months later (now) it’s developed a misfire. It started out as a p0303. I pulled the coil pack assembly, removed the boots then laid it sideways on the valve cover to where there was a small gap between the coils and the valve cover. All 4 coils were firing although it seems like my first attempt\n#3\nwas reluctant. (it now works every time) I pulled the\n#3\nplug and it was fouled with hydrocarbons. This car has had but doesn’t currently have a system too rich code. I also noticed both fuel trims go negative -15 to -20 when you rev the engine, but is near 0 at idle.\nI swapped the plug and it’s oil stained boot (spark tube seals?) with the\n#2\ncylinder hoping the misfire would follow it only to now be greeted with a p0300 when I put it back together. I also noticed it began to feel like a two cylinder misfire. Cleaning the plugs didn’t do anything, I put a fuel pressure tester on the fuel rail and fuel pressure was steady at almost 60PSI, revving the engine it stayed the same. I applied vacuum to the fuel pressure regulator and it dropped so I’m guessing that’s functioning properly. I’m not sure exactly how to test for a leaking injector. Kind of scratching my head I went back to the ignition system. I used a test light to verify there is power and control coming out of the ignition control module. I’m second guessing myself about the coil thinking my test may have been flawed. Should I have tested the coils with the boots on using a test light? I didn’t even think of testing the boots themselves.\nI also cleaned up the pins from the ignition module that plugs into the coil because I noticed there was a little bit of oil in there that got by the gasket somehow. I then cleaned the plugs again and noticed somewhat of a difference.\nNow when you first start it cold it feels like a single cylinder constant misfire with an additional cylinder missing every once in a while and when it idles down and warms up the two cylinder misfire becomes constant (it wants to die). Before I cleaned it it felt like a constant two cylinder misfire either way. Me messing with the ignition system and noticing a difference albeit small afterwards makes me think this is a spark problem and maybe not fuel related like I originally thought but tbh I don’t know what to think.\nOur plan a few days ago was to junk the car when she had a potential lead on borrowing another one but that didn’t pan out so I’m back here trying to do what I can with this.",

I want to keep a seat on the driver’s side instead of just removing it like most people do (to drive the vehicle when not working/leisurely).\nWhat I went with was I took the back of my driver seat off (it gets in the way when I’m working). This is all good, but now I have no seatbelt/seatback. I need to be able to get the seat out of the way when I begin my work route. The original driver seat will not go all the way down, only part of the way (it’s the motorized kind with heated seats), so I completely removed the seatback so I could work.\nIt occurred to me, though, that the backseat (pilot’s chairs) would be perfect for this because I can drive with a seatbelt on the driver’s side with the bucket seat from 2nd row when normal, fold it forward and flat (like you would do in the 2nd row), and boom the seat is out of the way and wholly folded down when I am working, and when I finish boom flip it back up and drive from the left side. Is this possible/feasible at all? I already tried measuring and realized I can’t simply swap the whole thing as the frames aren’t swappable; they won’t fit.\nCan I take the back (2nd row) seat off the back frame and put it on the front frame where the motorized driver seat mounts? If this isn’t possible, would any of you have suggestions? Do the manual seats lay all the way flat like I need? If they do, I could look for a manual seat so it can lay all the way down. I am entirely open to suggestions, I’ve thought about mounting a shoulder belt on the b pillar driver’s side, but that seems sketchy; it really sucks to drive around without a seat back/no seatbelt. I am open to suggestions and trying to find the best fix. I have tools to put the 2nd-row seat on the driver’s side. Maybe a little customization, such as some drilling/cutting, lol. I really appreciate any help you can provide. I’ll be happy to upload pictures if it would help or try to clarify if any of this is confusing.\nThank you in advance",

Unfortunately, I am still curious if I can put the back seat on the driver frame and whether anyone knows if it is actually possible. If it isn’t, I am considering getting something fabricated to meet my needs. That is my last option, though. I am willing to take any suggestions and try anything.\nMy current setup has a driver seat with a steering wheel, the seat just doesn’t have a seatback. I removed the seatback and that belt, but kept the bottom of the seat and replaced it with a lap belt (for now). I really need the shoulder strap (for high speeds driving), and while a seatback isn’t required, I’ve learned that it really sucks driving around without one. I have used a mesh/cargo net that I can take up and down as needed and still needing to mount a shoulder belt somewhere, but that seems pretty sketchy. Again, kind of a last option thing if I can’t come up with something better. I don’t want to mount a shoulder belt anywhere unless I have to. That is where the backseat idea comes in. I still have the seatback to the driver’s seat, but I don’t want to put it back on because it doesn’t go all the way down like I need whenever I am delivering my mail on the passenger side (so I can access packages, more mail, etc. behind me). Therefore, I need something that can lay all the way down when working, and go back upright when driving from the driver’s side (not working, on vacation, travelling, etc.). The cargo net meets these needs and works pretty good, but again I want to see if I can do something else before I settle on that.",

The mechanic diagnosed a “failing” mode door motor and replaced the Mode Door Actuator 87106-06140.  $350 for the part from Toyota (and a day-and-a-half wait for it to arrive), but only 1.5 hours labor (even though I thought they had said something about removing the dash).\nRegarding that 1.5 hours labor…  I picked the car up after hours Saturday night.

No experience w/a 11 Yukon but  my knucklhead diy’er ideas if my Corolla had these symptoms:\nI’d remove the canister for  look-see.  I’d focus on the finding why the gas pump keeps turning off during refueling.  In order to make room for fuel to enter the gas tank, the canister’s vent output path  has to allow  flow.  Something  may  be restricting that path.  Vent valve, vent  pathway filter clogged, vent pathway piping pinched or  clogged. It’s also possible the purge function isn’t doing enough purging, so the canister is clogged w/gasoline.  Don’t know about yours, but on my car it is fairly easy to remove the canister, if very heavy,  probably full of gasoline.\nAn HC tailpipe emissions test might be helpful too.",

    "selftext": "Hi,\nI purchased VW Tuareg 2011 on December 10, 2024. I paid 1000 advance and asked customer service representative (CSR) to certify and get license plate. The car dealer arranged certification and plate. On December 18 2024, I came to take the vehicle. When I got into the vehicle, I saw the check engine on the dashboard. The car dealer called the mechanic who took it to his garage. He cleaned one part and reset the engine light. I took the vehicle and drove to a restaurant for dinner. When I drove a few km, the check engine light came back again. I called the dealership manger and told him about the check engine light. He said you take it to home and tomorrow I will arrange to bring it back to fix the issue. When I arrived home and parked the vehicle, I applied the parking brake and noticed parking brake symbol on the dashboard. I did not drove any more as I left for vacation on next day. The manager of car dealership took the vehicle on December 21 or 22 to fix the parking brake and check engine light. As of today January 29, 2025, the car dealer is not able to fix the check engine light issue. The vehicle is with dealership since then. According to the manager of car dealership, they have replaced 4 parts one by one to fix the issue but could not succeed . As a matter of fact, I paid the full amount but never had the vehicle. This situation is very frustrating and dis-appointing and I do not know what to do. The dealership is not willing to refund the money. what to do? Please advise on this matter.\nThank you,\nAltaf",

I started noticing power issues and electrical flickering on my dash, headlights, and any lights inside the car. the probably is getting worse. The engine is struggling with power but once I run it it gets better but then the car has shaking or jolting throughout driving. I also seem to have an issue going in and out of 1-2 gear which makes me think there is also a transmission issue possibly.\nI was getting error codes for a misfire in one of my cylinders and thought maybe replacing there spark plugs and ignition coil would fix the issue. I replaced all 4 and the misfire code went away and the power did get better. Now the electrical issue still remains. What’s odd is when its cold outside or the engine is very cold I have very little issues. no flickering or little and much more power which makes me think it might be a short related to heat. I had the battery replaced and the alternator is testing great. (alternator is a new one put in 2021).\nAnother problem which may be realtered is when I’m slowing down my car as its coming to a stop has a really hard shift to first gear and makes a weird noise almost like the piston in the breaks is locking the releasing.",

Inadequate pressure means the CVT belt slips. Since it is generally OK when cold…when the transmission fluid is thicker… the pump can keep up, more or less. When it heats up, the fluid is thinner, the pump has difficulty building pressure and the CVT belt slips making MORE heat and causing more problems. For sure change the fluid, it is way overdue.\nAnd then there is that P0725… This is an engine speed error code. The engine speed is the crankshaft position sensor (CPS). Apparently this is a common symptom of a failing CPS in a Nissan. They are cheap so I’d just replace it and see how the engine and transmission reacts.\nGiven how poor these transmissions are, I’d suspect that is the bigger part of your problems.",

    "selftext": "The short story is everything tests good however the battery light is on and will not go off.  I tried several alternators, one being new, and put in a new battery and a new belt.\nI have a 2004 Toyota Matrix XR.  Several days ago my battery light started blinking on. It would only occasionally flicker on then off and it was mostly off.  A day after that it started to go on and off more regularly staying on for 5 to 10 seconds sometimes and being on around 50% of the time. I must also point out I have had zero problems starting the car and no problems with lights being dim or anything to make me think there’s an issue other than the battery light.\nI took the car into Advance Auto and they tested the car with their meter.  The test showed my batter was a little low and out of specification for the battery and it showed the alternator as being good.  So I bought a new battery and put it in.  This didn’t fix the battery light from coming on. I had Advance test the battery and it tested good.\nSo I figured it was the alternator and decided to put a new alternator in.  They only had the remanufactured alternator in stock so I purchased one and put it in.  This did not fix the battery light from coming on.  The light at this point was almost solid on and just flickered off occasionally.  I had advance test the remanufactured alternator and it tested good.  It showed 13.9 volts and 13.89 volts under load.  I felt it should be in the 14 volt range as the one I took out tested around 14.3 volts.  They said they would let me exchange or return it. I decided to get a new alternator instead of remanufactured so I had them order it and I picked it up the next day.\nThey tested the new alternator before I got it and it looked good showing 14.3 volts.  I put the new alternator in however it did not fix the battery light from coming on.  At this point the light is completely on and not flickering off at all.  My lights are bright and I’m not having any trouble starting.  I drove the car around for half hour or so figuring that maybe the battery light is on because the battery was low and needed some charging however the batter light stayed on.  Again, I had no trouble with dim lights and no signs of trouble except the battery light being on.  I took the car out again after dark and drove around for about a half hour with the lights on and the windshield wipers running.  No signs of low battery or any issues.  I’m going to take the car into Advance and have them check it again and I’m pretty sure everything will pass.\nI’m not sure what to do or what to check.  Could this be a shorted or broken wire?  Is there a blown fuse that could cause this?  Could the Computer be bad or corrupted?",

I assume the connection at the battery was cleaned and sprayed (anti corrosive) and the cables are in good condition. The other end, especially the ground (negative), can also corrode.\nYou can quickly test the negative cable by hooking jumper a jumper cable to the negative battery connection, the other end to a convenient ground. If the light goes out, it’s either the battery cable, or the engine grounding strap. If grounding to the engine doesn’t work, try grounding to a bolt on the body. (If the second works, it could be a corroded engine-to-chassis connection.)\nRust is a poor conductor and can add enough resistance to cause erratic electrical behavior.",

I was installing a new garage door on my garage at the same time and have just recently recorded what has been done to address the various symptoms, the worst of which was a no-start when hot condition. In addition to the P0171 that kept coming and going, the ECU started throwing a P0507. This latter was also a long-time issue that the owner kept clearing with a code reader. It came back since I got involved. The actual condition on this car that is associated with this code is a fluctuating idle. I’m pretty sure I got it in hand.\nFunny thing, the owner took it to a shop to try to deal with the no-start when hot condition and they shop read the P0171 code and decided on the spot to change the O2 sensor. When I heard about it I thought it was like shooting messenger.\nThese people are friends and have been living with these issues for about a year now, so there is no hurry. I am certain I can get the car right again. They trust me 100%. It is a matter of another week when a new throttle body arrives to deal with the fluctuating high idle. You can’t buy a new throttle position sensor or a new idle air control valve for this car. You have to buy a whole new throttle body. And you have to be careful which one you buy, as some are sold without the IAC valve. If the IAC is the problem, you are stuck if you buy a TB without it.",

If pressure drops quickly, the vehicle may have a leaky fuel line, a leaky fuel pump check valve, a leaky fuel pressure regulator or one or more leaky fuel injectors. Low residual fuel pressure can cause hard starting and vapor lock during hot weather.\nTester",

        "body": "It sounds like your shop is one the right track focusing on the emissions system’s evap hardware.  When you pour gas into the tank there has to be a path to allow the air/fuel vapors already inside the tank to escape, otherwise there’s no room to allow more fuel and the pump shuts off.  The usual design for OBD II cars (like yours, presumably ) is those gasses are piped from the gas tank into the evap canister, which holds  the fuel vapors for later use, and vents the air segment of the gasses   to the atmosphere.  In your case the canister or the replacement parts may be faulty.  Or one of the pathway’s  pipes is pinched or otherwise  blocked. Could also be a software control problem, wiring harness, faulty electrical connector etc.  About the only thing you can do  is to ask your shop to keep looking, and check for any stored diagnostic codes.\nNote:  I’m just a knucklehead diy’er with no experience with a 2010 Avalanche, just posting an opinion is all .  Hope it helps.",
