They’ll handle 6k–9k lbs with ease if properly designed.\n\nBut here’s what you should NEVER trust under a car:\n\n❌ PVC – Brittle, deforms, cracks under load\n❌ Polycarbonate (PC) – UV-sensitive, not ideal under compression\n❌ ABS – Brittle in cold, weak fatigue resistance\n❌ Polystyrene (PS) – Total garbage for structural use\n❌ PLA/Bioplastics – Melts in heat, deforms easily\n\n🚩 Red flags to avoid:\n\t•\tNo material listed\n\t•\tThin walls, glossy finish\n\t•\t“Heavy-duty plastic” but no actual specs\n\t•\tSuspiciously cheap\n\nBottom line: If it’s not HDPE or known composite, don’t put your life under it.\nPlastic can absolutely outperform metal for regular garage use—if it’s the right kind.

Both would be better than plastic longterm as plastic degrades over the years. I always put a jackstand under the car. Hell sometimes i’ll put two on one corner and even an old spare tire.

It’s gotta be a joke because it looks like he’s replaced his brakes before. Only a DIY’er would think a drilled and slotted rotor is a good idea.  \n  \nI’m a DIY’er and I’m mostly all for it, but sometimes some people might want to really consider if they should proceed or take it to a garage.

Is it something super serious? i’ll be able to take my car in on Tuesday when i’m off. I did notice that my a/c wasn’t getting cold really at all, the whole 30 minutes the temp was lukewarm, could it be something with the coolant? I’ve noticed recently on extremely hot days my a/c hasn’t been great at cooling my car down as much as i’d like.\n\nI dont know anything about cars so if you have any other questions to help figure it out i’d be glad to answer!

It has sat in heated garages it's whole life. The compressor appears to be the original GM / Harrison R-4 unit and there's no conversion labels or R-134a fittings in-place. Both the high and low side fittings still had their plastic caps on them.\n\nThe reason I ask is because the system doesn't perform well at dead-stops anymore and the pancake compressor is doing pancake compressor things (sounds like it's tumbling gravel), so I'm going to convert it, but if it still really is R-12 I'd like to recover that into an existing cylinder of R-12 I have. Obviously though, I don't want to accidentally contaminate my existing R-12 with something else.\n\nIf this was your car, how confident would you be in this car still having a charge of R-12?",

This might happen every day for a week and then work fine for months, so it was very hard to diagnose.

If you need information for a repair, you don't go to forums as a mechanic.\n\nYou go to Alldata, Identifix, or the manufacturer (Tech Connect, Service Info, HDS, etc.). Mechanics book shelves have been entirely replaced by the internet.\n\nI'm a younger tech, but I've worked at a couple of shops that kept their bookshelves, one a motorcycle shop, one a customs/classics shop.\n\nThese days, even if you're not a mechanic, you can usually get digital Chilton/Haynes manuals for free from your local library. They're invaluable resources for completing a proper repair, but keep in mind that experience is always the best resource, even if it's just someone you can call to ask a couple questions, which is what internet forums do valuable provide(when taken with a grain of salt).",

So many engines went in that car, and there's so many different variations that make two years or two engines, or two body styles are different enough from each other that this results in so much clutter the authors forget some parts. \n\nFor example, if you want to change the spark plugs on a 2.7 Sebring convertible, you will find Haynes does not include that information. \n \nWhy? Because they already filled a whole page or two talking about the other engines. I speculate the other issue is that the process for replacing spark plugs on a 06 Sebring convertible is also a page long or more process in itself.\n\n You will not learn of the nightmare of a process it is to do this on a 2.7 from Haynes. There is no mention of undoing a transmission mount to lower the engine an inch for the back plugs.\n\nEdit: \nOh, a little trivia, Chrysler switched to using coils that have harder plastic at the ends at some point in the 2004 model year. So to add to the confusion, some 2.7's in a Sebring or Stratus require the engine to be lowered for access to rear plugs. Some do not.",

They were nearly identical, and I was extremely disappointed at how generic they both are. \n\nThe information is very cookiecutter, and the pictures are exactly the same as when the book was first published in like 1992. Black and white, low resolution printing, and vague. \n\nSome of their information is treated as applicable across all body and engine combos across 15 years of the model and it's simply not true.",

[while charging, battery produces hydrogen gas.--  hydrogen gas explodes - no smoking]  The battery acid can eat metal, paint, rust, clothes, skin, eyes, shoes and more.\n\nIf at anytime your skin feels like it's burning, wash area with soap. repeat.  Maybe repeat washing again, with soap.   In the eyes, seek medical attention immediately. \n\nWear gloves, the type you use to wash dishes, throw away when job is completed.  Do not reuse for any reason.\n\nRemove battery carefully ---- battery acid will eat your clothes.\n\nInstall new battery and have the charging circuit checked out, immediately.   Without more info from you, your alternator may be over charging the battery.  <if so. needs replacing the alternator,  as well. >  Most auto parts stores will check out your alternator for FREE.  ie: auto zone, pep boys, NAPA, O'reillys, --  NOT WalMart, or NOT Target.\n\nNote:  when buying a new battery, get those red and green felt material, washers to protect battery from crusty terminals in the future.  Found where ever they sell new batteries.  Very cheap insurance. \n\nNote 2:  For - maybe a week - keep your eye on the battery guage next to the speedometer ....  look for clues to over charging.   Over charging will burn out light bulbs,  brake lights, headlights, cars computer and more.\n\nBaking soda is a neutralizer for battery acid spills.  Do not get inside the new battery, it will kill your brand new battery.\n\nI don't mean to scare you, but battery acid mistakes are dangerous.   Just use your head.\n\nGo wash your hands with soap.",

Now with that being said, you'll always find cheaper prices with shadetree mechanics, but you run the risk of someone fucking up your shit and then you being shit out of luck because they're not a real licensed professional and you let them into your thousands of dollars worth piece of equipment. It's very hard to say if he's being honest or not, I understand. But replacing a valve cover is a fairly simple job. I'd charge you about 200-300 for it. But those are my prices. You'd just have to call around and quote a valve cover replacement in your shops. This could easily be repaired without replacing the valve cover itself. You could simply just switch out and renew the gaskets. The best way to see if you're getting ripped off would be to get multiple quotes yourself, and if he's still cheaper, then it's your choice to risk letting him work on your vehicle.",

I charge upwards of 75, I do great quality work and unfortunately find myself fixing mechanics messes.\n\nI give him props for quoting the whole valve cover and not just the gasket (if that’s what he meant to do) \nReason being is all the time, Mazdas, Nissans and so fourth are known for valve cover warpage, so you could do the whole job replace the gasket and it still leak ask me how I know",

I expect them to hold weight no matter WHERE I put them - axle, frame rail, pumpkin, wherever. \n\nI buy stuff from HFT with a 100% safety factor.  Which means for a 3000 pound car, its a 3 ton jack stand.  More, if I'm feeling a little paranoid that day, which is not unusual.\n\nI never rely solely on the jack, I always use MULTIPLE jack stands. ANDWHEN THE WHEELS COME OFF, THE RIMS ARE POSITIONED UNDER THE FRAME RAILS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION.  In the event of total jackstand/jack failure, I might get squeezed and bruised, but I dont get crushed.  I'm careful to position the steel rims of my tires under the frame rails. not under suspension parts.\n\nYour photos have kinda pissed all over my holiday weekend.\n\nBut maybe its something we all needed to see.

Either it will kick in after I've driven for a few seconds or if I switch the headlights on after turning the car on before driving, that works 9/10 times.. The powersteering never locks up during driving only when I start and only occasionally. I have taken it to two mechanics who can't identify the issue. \n\nI thought that was an interesting temporary solution to the issue so thought I'd share it, anyone experienced the same or have any idea about what's going on?

I can’t go in reverse at all.\n\nI tried loosening the arms to the transmission and seeing if I can get them working again after alighting them. I did see a big improvement in 2nd to third, however I still have the same issue.\n\nAny ideas? I’m hoping it’s not the shift collar as I know those are obsolete… although a 79 could be modified…\n\nAny suggestions on where to start would be amazing!",

To do this, I unplugged my driver's seat to lift up a section of the carpet. However, after reconnecting the seat, I discovered that it no longer moves. This is puzzling, as it was functioning properly before.  \n  \nI can hear the seat motors engaging when I press the switches, and I attempted to recall the seat position using the memory switches on the door, but only the side mirrors adjust when I do that. Could it be that unplugging the seat for a few hours caused the seat control module to lose its settings and now needs to be reprogrammed? I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights anyone might have. ",

        "selftext": "Curious if anyone could help offer some advice about what they would do in my situation? 1995 Volvo 940 wagon inspected and came back with a few issue. Minor issues include brake pad, fluid flushes, lights (but these will be fixed likely regardless because why not) The bigger issues notably of my concern are the following: Leaking from upper radiator hose area, all shocks worn, middle muffler corrosion, crack in the steering frame, oil cooler lines and oil swollen/contaminated, and also: (rear of engine, oil cooler, transmission and steering rack covered in oil and degrease needed to confirm locations of leaks) Could anyone offer some advice if the car would even be worth putting my money into and if there would be a possibility I could ever sell it for anything or is it basically a money pit at this point. Thank you.",

I’ve tested the pcm, checked every fuse, checked the wiring and replaced the starter and battery and I just can’t get it to start up. \n\nFirst of all I replaced the battery as it wasn’t holding voltage and was just old. I then tried to start it up again and I didn’t hear any noise coming from the starter, not even a click. I removed the starter, bench tested it and it was dead. I replaced it and I sometimes got a click sometimes nothing. I checked my starter relay and it was going bad so I replaced it. I went to start it again and I got a single click every time I tried to start it up.I thought maybe the new starter was faulty and it just wasn’t engaging.  I removed, tested it, and it worked fine on the bench. I go to put it back on, I make sure I didn’t flip anything and start thinking it might be an ignition issue or maybe the gear selector wasn’t seating properly, so I put it in gear by hand and send 12v to the starter directly to engage it and I got a single click.\n\nI just know what could be wrong as everything else on it works fine. Could the battery not be putting out enough amps but still read fine on a tester and multimeter? I know is getting gas and air, and it’s holding compression. Do I resort to black magic or voodoo or smthn? ",

You've replaced the socket, so it wasn't the problem.  The problem is on a single lamp assembly, so it's not likely a fuse or relay.  The problem is most likely shorts in the wiring.  The only way the light can stay on with the car off, other than timed delay, is that the bulb has ground and power.  It should have ground at all times, so it is shorted to power somewhere. If you find that short, then it will likely solve the turn signal as well.  With that being said, electricity can be temperamental.  I first recommend that you replace the turn signal bulb with the left side bulb which is working correctly.  See what happens.  If it still acts up, then put that bulb back on the left side.  Lastly, your dash turn signal light is flashing faster because that front bulb is not working, that's a normal event.",

        "selftext": "I was driving my 2009 Audi a4 Quattro 2.0t for a road trip after buying it used and it hadn't been giving my many problems. At one point I decide to stop and get gas, so I pull up to the gas pump and turn off the engine, take out the key and realize that I didn't roll the window down (this was in New Jersey where it's full service gas stations). I put the key back in and try to turn on the ignition so I can lower the window but then the car immediately died. The lights on the dash briefly turned on for a split second but then faded off. I tried starting the car again or turning on the ignition again but it was fully dead with seemingly no power. I had to have someone jump start the car (which also gave some trouble because they jumped it and the engine turned on but then it all shut off once they removed the jumper cables... it only stayed on after a second jump). I found this wierd since there weren't any alternator or battery related lights lit and the engine had previously been starting very quickly and powerfully, which made sense since I was told the battery and starter were both new.\n\nAnyways, I drove the car home for another two hours and ran into no more problems. When I parked the car I turned off the engine and waited like ten seconds to see if it would die again without the engine running but the lights stayed on. I haven't yet gone back to the car yet to see if it starts or even has power, but I will tomorrow and will update this.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any ideas what could be causing this. The MIL (check engine light) came on early in that 1000+ mile road trip but the engine sounded fine and had new oil so I just kept going. I dont suspect that the check engine light could hint at this problem but maybe?",

My car started making some knocking rattling noises so i started trying to figure out what the noise was.. looked at the rod bearings everything was all good, so i put the oil pan back on. I took off the timing cover and the chain seemed a little loose so i replaced it.. I messed up the timing and I broke all my exhaust valves like a dumb ass.. any who, I got a used head that came with all the valves, lifters and cams in the head.. so i cleaned everything up real good, slapped them in the car with new head bolts, a head gasket all the gaskets that i touched during the entire process i replaced. (got a gasket kit for my car(2008 mazda 3 2.0L)) So, start the car again and it's making a good rattling knocking sound... idk what's up haven't had time to take off valve cover and do any kind of diagnosing. Does any one have any ideas that might be able to help my dumb ass? Thanks in advance",

After parking it can't get started again. \n\nContents of the video is me holding the key at its maximum turn capability and the dashboard lights flicking on and off, but the engine not engaging. \n\nThe lights on the dashboard make me thing it could be a battery issue but I've tried charging the battery with a Noco Boost XP Ultrasafe Jump Starter 12V 1500A but no change. Have also tried opening the fuse box and gently pushing in all the connections to make sure nothing's loose\n\nIve checked the oil and although it's low it's not empty or dangerously low. We'll take it to a mechanic regardless but would love to be able to drive it there and avoid a callout fee. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

It went constant with the wheel speed, faster or slower depending on speed. I was going dead straight at the time.

My thought is pressure is too high causing the leak (video link below showing leak) . Oil pan gasket has been replaced twice, and oil pan replaced once.\n\n***Question: will putting a oil pressure in oil valve back in oil pan help relieve pressure, or is this valve only activated by dod/afm?

Recently it started losing coolant incredibly rapidly and took it to the mechanic who said it has blown its head gasket and would cost +3500 AUD to fix. \n\nI'm obviously incredible devastated at having no car and no money, I want to ask, is it possible for me to repair this by myself? If I'm happy spending some significant time on it, learning online etc and buy a new gasket, can I do it. I realise \"anyone\" can learn anything, but I'm more asking to those more experienced if it's feasible or not, and maybe how I would go about figuring out how to do it.\n\nAppreciate any responses.\n\nCheers",

You’ll need to have a shop check the head itself to see if it needs to be machined and likewise the mating surface on the block needs to be checked for trueness. You might be better off to just getting a used low mileage one off car parts.com and save yourself a lot of money and time.",

It's been sitting all that time without cover, it's never moved, idlers have mild surface corrosion. \nDoes it damage a belt to sit so long with the pressure points constantly on the same spot for so long? The idlers, tensioner and water pump roller surfaces have minor corrosion, plus assorted rat crap on everything. \nBelt kits aren't cheap and I hate replacing stuff that doesn't need replacement, but I'll do so if folks feel in that situation stuff is compromised because it's sat. It's a 7 grand car I picked up for $400 cause it had to be moved, so easy enough to invest in it if needed. \n",

I took it to him a second time and he fixed it 10 days later which today the exact same thing happened. This getting quite frustrating cause this is the 3rd time having to deal with this. Take into consideration that I do live in the desert where it got up to 93 degrees today. 1st time it happened while I was driving on the highway, 2nd time happened after I let the car idle for about 30 minutes, and 3rd time today it happened after I let the car idle for 5 minutes and drove it about 7 miles. Can I please get some insight as to why this keeps happening and some solutions, also those pictures of the hose under the car are from when I tried to fix it on my own before letting the mechanic fix it himself ",

        "selftext": "Ac compressor swap\n\nHey just did an ac compressor swap on my '17 versa note to solve a squeaky belt (old one was seizing). Trying to recharge to system with a manifold gauge set. Held vacuum for 30, cont. Vacuum to purge air and moisture for 45 after that before attempting recharge. Ac on, full cold full blow, recirculate (not sure if this mattered). \n\nSet ref to fill slowly, didnt see or hear clutch kick on ~25psi stupidly got distracted with something falling and missed psi jumping to 60. Instantly vented down to 30 when i noticed. Still no compressor clutch engagement. It was a cheap amazon compressor so i could have guessed id have issues. \n\nI checked the fuses and one looked blown to hell, swapped with spare still nothing. Didnt have time to check relays or coil wire for continuity, but i was able to user my feeler to check that .026in (.001 higher that max spec fit into air gap, could that be the issue? Also how much resistance should i feel trying to spin the clutch alone before i worry about the new one being partially seized. Dont have an ultra precise tool but id say maybe 10-15ftlbs of force with my hand to break friction. \n\nThe pulley spins fantastic, i do get a slight chirp every now and then but it may be a tension issue as i had to tighten the manual tensioner twice past what rule of thumb would say is spec (i dont have a tension reader) before the squeal went away. Might just need another ¼ turn. \n\nAny help is greatly appreciated. Im a self/youtube  taught sae wannabe with a few months shop experience years ago and no cash to pay a shop right now. ",

The target areas in refill can gauge are only for while compressor is running.  At 60PSI and no compressor engagement, it’s under charged.  30 static pressure is too low for most systems to engage compressor though they might cycle it briefly.  If it’s a 100 degrees out, static on a full charge could be as high as 150\n\n\nIf you didn’t drain the oil out of new compressor it’s not going to cool as well.  The compressors come with a full fill but unless ur replacing everything, the old oil is distributed all through the system so you end up with over-oiling condition.  Supposed to drain and measure what’s still in the old one and adjust the new one to the same amount.",

It is getting 100+ outside, though I can always go early in the morning or later at night to get it cooler.

The new rad that I got came from ebay, listing said it was new but it was slightly bent and kinda looked like some fins have been straightened but doesn't seem like many were unless they spent a crazy amount of time on it. Do you think maybe the rad had something in it?

        "selftext": "\nI have a 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport 2.0L turbo engine that will not charge. The battery is fresh and the alternator is new.\n\nI’ve done a lot of work in this car in the past few months, recently I replaced the turbo carriage and did a coolant flush. While flushing the coolant the original battery died so I bought a new one and realized it wasn’t charging. (12.2v when running and 11.7v with headlights lights on) \n\nThere are no warning lights on the dash or any codes. Main fuse is good and there is continuity between the positive lug of the alternator and the positive terminal of the battery. Case of the alternator is grounded.\n\nNo visual damage on the connector (Picture included), tested voltages and found the following:\n\nRed - 0.37V (125Hz PWM pulse tested with oscilloscope) \nGreen - 8.06V \nWhite - 4.66V\n\nNot sure which of these signals corresponds to each wire on the connector or whether or not they are in spec. I couldn’t find much documentation on the pinout of the connector.\n\nI’m not sure where to go from here, and I’m hoping there’s a simple answer that someone with experience can point me towards. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

Then i decided to try to do an idle air volume re-learn because the main issue was my idle rpm was around 1100. After doing the re-learn the rpms dropped to normal and the cel went off for about half a day, then the CEL came back on but the rpms were still low. So i checked the code and now it says im getting a P0420 code, something to do with the cats? Im gonna try checking the o2 sensors first, but anyone got any ideas what is going on here, any help will be greatly appreciated, mainly because cats are so pricey lmao.",

I watched a few videos, read a few articles, honestly thought I was set. Nope. I hate springs. I hate the wheel cylinder. I hate the adjuster.  \n\nI already broke a wheel cylinder cause I put too much pressure on one side and over stroked it and I may have bent the adjuster level too much for it to function properly.  \n\nIs this a common thing or a skill issue? Any advice? ",

        "selftext": "Trying to change out the front sway bar on my 2005 Buick Century, got the old one off but struggling to get the new one in place. I can get one end of the sway bar properly seated on one side by just feeding it through the opening but sway bar will pop over the tirerod on the opposite side. I’m using an alternate jack point like in the front middle of the car as the side jack points are rusted out, so I’m struggling to lift the control arm for a better angle without shifting the car off the jack stands. Afraid to lower the subframe(?) as the parts are severely old and rusted and I’m working with very limited tools, plus I don’t think I can lower the subframe based on where I currently have the jack stands placed. \n\nAny advice on how I can get the new sway bar in properly without ending up above the tirerods? Preferably without needing to remove more parts. ",

That should change where the tie rod sits(front to back) It may or may not help.\n\nAnother idea is to either pop off the tie rod from the knuckle, or (less invasive) mark the tie-rod end to inner-tie-rod relationship and carefully unscrew the tie rod end inner tie rod. Be very careful about counting the turns or better, back the jam-nut off a TINY amount and be careful not to touch it again, so when you turn it back in you know almost where the rod should stop and you can use the marks to finalize it.",

        "selftext": "Hi, I have a farily old (1997 lancer) that keeps getting its injectors clogged with gum. The problem is temporarily solved if I clean the injector manually. But it is not feasible for me to clean the injectors every time I am about to use the car. It takes about 3 weeks of sitting for it to start clogging.\n\nThis car has previously sat for quite some time during the pandemic, but it ran fine even after a few more tanks of fresh gas. I put some fuel system cleaner in it a few times and I worry that it has dislodged the gum that may have previously existed as an occlusion in the lines.\n\nI am planning to replace the fuel filter soon and I need to know if I need to do the rail and even the hoses in the engine bay. What can I use to clean the rail, or even the hoses? Is it time for a hose replacement?\n\n\nSome other info:\nThe fuel pump is still factory, as well as the injectors and pressure regulator. Car had no fueling issues before.",

When I try to push the ignition coil down onto the spark plug, it feels like there's air pressure or a spring pushing the spark plug back out. I tested the same coil on the old spark plugs I removed, and I'm getting the same problem. I checked online, and people say the ignition coil should firmly attach to the spark plug with no resistance.  \n  \nIs this normal? Has anyone else experienced this issue? Thank you!",

If I jack up the car and spring the wheel, it sounds fine.\n\nThe squeak has slowly gotten worse over the last 6 months.  Should I just go ahead and replace the wheel bearing?  Or are there other likely causes I should rule out?\n\n150k miles on the car.\n\nThanks\n\n  ",

Any ideas on what it may be?\n\nCar is a 2013 Hyundai Azera with about 160k. From what I remember the steering column doesn't go all the way through the firewall and is electronical. The noise sounds like it's coming from the steering wheel itself (or near the base of it). Noise mainly only happens on large bumps or if the road is rough for an extended period of time. Doesn't matter if the bump is on the left or right side of the car, will still make the noise equally as loud.",

        "selftext": "I have a 2019 Audi Q5 that I purchased with original factory brakes at approximately 28,000 miles. A week after acquiring the car, I noticed a pulsation in the brake pedal and throughout the vehicle while braking. This pulsation didn’t occur immediately when I applied the brake but rather about a second or two later. I suspect that the brakes were pulsating due to heat buildup. Therefore, I replaced only the front rotors because the rear rotors lacked any lip, and the front and rear pads were approximately 9 millimeters thick. While in the brake system, I thoroughly lubricated and cleaned everything. After replacing the rotors, the pulsation subsided for about 15,000 miles, but it has since returned. My question is, am I somehow overheating the brakes, or are the rotors and pads of poor quality? I assume that the factory brake pads are ceramic because they haven’t worn down the new front rotors at all over the course of the 15,000 miles. The specifications for the front rotor are 38 millimeters, and they are still at that size. Approximately 95% of my driving involves regular rural commuting to and from work, with minimal stops and heavy braking. The remaining 5% of my driving involves mountain driving with heavy braking, high speeds, and heavy weight loads. I’m also considering purchasing a small trailer to assist me in hauling items that I need for various projects. I’m wondering if this 5% of my driving is excessive for the factory plain rotors and pads. I was contemplating replacing the plain rotors with slotted rotors before I replace the brakes. Is this a suitable option? The rotors that I put in the front were Zimmerman. The pads are OE Audi (Textar).",

        "selftext": "I have been working on & maintaining this Commy for the almost 4 years Ive had it, recently I've been having a problem with what feels like clunking / gear hunting especially between the 60-80kmph range, I've tested my throttle body absolute position and it was sitting at 15% at idle (Idle is smooth and fine sitting around the 600rpm range)... I've installed a new TB and performed a re-learn on the ECU, but my TB is still sitting open around 13% at idle.\n\n  \nNot sure if this has anything to do with the problems I am facing or maybe my transmission is going out... (fluids are fine, and upon inspection of the sump only a small amount of metal dust was found in there)\n\n  \nIf anyone had any Ideas as to what may be happening (maybe i need to get a TB re-learn done with a proper scanner at the shop?) please let me know, or if i should consider selling the car (sitting at 270kms) even though I have put a lot of work into it (I would prefer to save it) \\*face palm\\*",

        "selftext": "I have been attempting to replace the wheel bearing and seal on my 2005 Ford f150 XL with 9.75 differential.  The original issue I was having was an emergency brake engaging on its own and prior to that the emergency brake felt completely worn out and didn't function properly.  After buying all the parts to replace the parking brake I removed the wheels and noticed the passenger side was covered in oil.  I then went and bought everything to replace the seal and bearing.  I had trouble getting the seal and bearing to seat completely (it is still about 1mm or less out of place).  I was using a piece of PVC to try and seat them.  I decided to order the actual tool for this and while I waited for it I have been replacing the parking brake components on both sides.  I had the axle removed on the passenger side to get to the seal.  This made getting to the parking brake parts much easier so I removed the axle on the driver side as well.  After finishing installing both sides of parking brake parts I was about to put on the new rotor and do the final parking brake adjustment.  I turned the axle not thinking about the differential being taken apart and heard something drop out of it.  I thought it was the c-clip, but no it was a spider gear.  I have never worked on the differential before and don't know how to get this part back in properly.  \n\nCould someone please give me some advice.  I am going to be watching videos for the next few hours trying to figure this out my own.  I need my truck to get to work on Tuesday.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.",

        "selftext": "Hi, I have a broken lense on the driver's side headlight assembly (HID) of a 2011 Buick Regal. Looked at a bunch of gm part sellers and they're all charging C$1,400 for it. I am going to sell the car after fixing the headlight, expecting ~C$8,000 for it.\n\nI see 1 or 2 headlights used on eBay for c$520 + C$120 shipping...how much would I need to pay a mechanic to put it on? \n\nGiven the age of the car, probably not something I could find at a pick and pull and might take unknowledgeable me 2 hrs to get off. Are there any other options I'm missing, mechanics that might be able to source the part or something?\n\nLots of online options for the same assembly in halogen for C$250, I know they can't be swapped 1 for 1 but is there a rewiring that could be done cheaper than installing a $500 more expensive headlight?",

So I suspect there is air in the cooling system because the heater isn’t working properly and it recently had a coolant flush. So I’m seeing videos of people with the bmw v6 engine that has an electric water pump just purge the air out of the cooling system by turning the electric water pump on while the engine is off which is super easy. In my case the water pump on my car is mechanically driven so I can’t just flow the coolant without turning on the engine. So is it a good idea to turn on the engine with the coolant reservoir cap off and let the bubbles come out?",

Recently my car (2009 toyota corolla) started making this screeching . whimpering noise every time I drive slow, however they silence when I press on the brakes. I took them to a mechanic and he told me that all my brakes are fine, and that the noise is because the rear drums and brake shoes are diluted from the weather. It recently did rain heavily but it has been sunny for about 3-4 days now, and the noise has not gotten away. I tried to ask him if he is sure and that my car has never made this noise before after rain and he kept telling me that there is nothing to worry about and that is just from the rain. I don't know much about cars but my gut tells me that this can't be right. Thoughts?",

If the noise comes from the back wheels, it could be rear wheel bearings.  \n\nOne thing you could try is go to an empty parking lot or other open space, back up then stop vigorously about a half dozen times.

Suspension is stock, no lowering springs etc. \nI live in Bulgaria, so shops around here don't have any experience with these cars. I saw in rockauto adjustable ball joints(mine are bad). Are these adjustable ball joints(moog, trw, delphi) good option in the long run? Or I should go for normal ball joints and adjustable upper control arms(Moog, Megan racing, SPC) ? ",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nA friend asked for help because their vehicle was throwing a P0303 code and they noticed sluggish acceleration and rough idle. They had just a couple weeks prior had some work done to the car including a new head gasket. They initially told me they knew what was wrong and wanted to change the spark plug and ignition coil on the third cylinder so I did that for them but the issue persists.\n\nI did a more thorough sweep of potential causes but did not seem to locate any issues. So far this is what has been done. vehicle is a 2015 Chevrolet Equinox 2.4L 4 cylinder ecotec.\n\nIgnition coil and spark plug swapped on cylinder 3.\n\nChecked wiring on all cylinders for damage but found no obvious damage.\n\nChecked for a potential vacuum leak using the carb cleaner method but found no leak and heard no change in idle during testing.\n\nremoved, cleaned, and returned to original position all ignition coils, spark plugs, and wiring to them. (the mechanic that had done the work previously used an absurd amount of dielectric grease and I was concerned that might be a potential cause of an issue).\n\ncompleted a compression test on all 4 cylinders which I believe is ok but it's the first time I have done one. I did make one possible mistake I think, some sources said a cold compression test was fine, most said to get vehicle to operating temp first but I did not.\n\nCyl 1: 193      Cyl 2: 198     Cyl 3: 193   Cyl 4: 205\n\nI had them complete six cycles with each cylinder though I think if I recall they might have done 7 on Cyl 4. I noticed with each additional cycle the compression gauge jumped to a higher number, probably about 5-10 psi more with each cycle so if that trend continued and cyl 4 got an extra cycle that sounds about right.\n\nI wanted to remove and clean the fuel injectors but realized I did not have replacement gaskets for the fuel pump or anything so I left it alone for now.\n\nI cleaned up a lot of things under the hood and I noticed a good amount of oily build up in the pcv hose which I am unsure if that is normal or a cause for concern. I cleaned it as best I could as well as the ports it attaches too.\n\nWe test drove it after reassembling everything and I was unable to hear anything out of the ordinary and in the short drive the check engine light did not come back on but they were driving and reported that it still felt really sluggish and that they thought the rpm was higher than normal for the intensity of the driving but it didn't seem out of the ordinary in my experience. We mostly just drove around a small town up and down a few moderate hills and it stayed around 2 to 3k rpm but since they drive the car regularly I figured I would mention it.\n\nWe did also put a fuel system cleaner in the gas with the hopes that if there is a clog or build up in the fuel system it would clear it out but they have not driven it much since adding that so unlikely to have caused any changes in the meantime.\n\nAnyway I am at a bit of a loss as to next steps and was hoping someone could shed some light on possible causes and what to do next. I am not overly experienced as an amateur mechanic but if it is something I could do I would prefer to and save them the money of taking it to a shop as they have already put thousands into the vehicle prior to asking for help.\n\nPS sorry for making this so long I tend to be overly detailed but I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read it and offer help. Thanks in advance!\n\n  \nEdit to add that the last few times the light has come on and they noticed it they were driving on the highway at approximately 65-70mph and the vehicle had been running long enough to be at operating temp.

P0303, is cylinder 3. Also is ur spark plug gapped correctly. U could still have a fuel issue like clogged injector or wiring to injector. Check those. When you swapped plugs and coil with another cylinder, did code change to that cylinder ? Or just buy new coil n plug ?",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI have a 2021 Chrysler Pacifica with approximately 100k miles. \n\n6 months ago our car died. A local mechanic replaced both batteries and it ran great for 5 months.\n\n1 month ago, our car died again and we took it to our local Chrysler dealership. They replaced both batteries (this time with a 3 year warrantee).\n\nSince then our van is shifting out of gear while we're driving. It started shifting into neutral and we'd have to coast to the side of the road, put it back into Drive. We took it back to the dealership and they changed the transmission module. \n\nWe left the shop and it happened again... still slipping into neutral when we drive. It happens inconsistently and we can't find any commonalities of what causes it (e.g., speeding up real fast, slowing down real fast, etc.). We get the error message to \"service shifter\"\n\nWhat is occurring now is the car is tries shifting into park and we get the error message \"car is driving too fast to shift into park\". We then pull over to the side and put it back in drive and keep on our merry way.\n\nA mechanic friend of mine said that we could change the ECM connector on the Can C Star Connector. We did that... it didn't help at all. \n\nI'm stumped. \n\nOur dealership can't replicate the error so they cant' diagnose it. It only happens when we drive...\n\nAny help would be highly recommended. I'm desperate. This is my wife's car and we have kids. I hate the idea of them getting stranded again...\n\nThank you in advance.",

I had a 13 yr old Honda CRV previously with 287,000 miles and it ran beautifully until it finally needed too much work and I decided to buy the new one. \n\nMy latest problem is that about a month ago all of the warning lights came on and it failed inspection. I brought it up to a local mechanic to check it out and I also reported that it was running kinda sluggish. He looked online and found that there was a recall on the fuel pump and advised me to take it to Honda Service dept. I had it towed up to Honda because it sounded like the engine was misfiring and I could smell gas.  They currently have it and are in the process of replacing the fuel pump but now tell me that the \"bad news\" is that I need to have two fuel injectors replaced and it will cost 2,000!  They tell me that the faulty fuel pump is in no way to blame for the damaged fuel injectors. Is this just a coincidence or are they trying to weasel out of assuming responsibility for the damaged fuel injectors? From what little I read online, it seems a faulty pump can indeed affect the fuel injectors. Should I fight it? I'll pay if it's legit but not if they're trying to scam me. \n\nAny advice is appreciated, thank you!",

Basically the fuel pump has a chance to fail entirely due a design issue from the manufacturer of the pump allowing parts of the pump to swell and sieze. This kind of complete failure will not affect the injectors as no debris will be sent down the fuel lines. The directive from Honda is to replace the pumps only\n\nAnd secondly, because this is a recall from Honda, dealerships’ hands are very much tied in what they can do. Honda gives very specific directions and deviating from them will mean Honda won’t pay for the recall. They didn’t mention injectors in the recall, so if a dealer tried to install them during the recall, the entire thing would get denied and the dealer would be paying out of pocket for your repairs.

Modern vehicles will stop charging the battery if it detects that it’s fully charged. That said, if the battery has NEVER been replaced, your battery could be needing to be changed soon just based on the fact that it’s 5+ years old.",

My best advice is to get your oil changes at the dealership if price seems fair, they use original factory parts and they give you detailed multipoint inspections since they see your car multiple times a day and they are factory trained to recognize specific issues about your car. Sometimes if you have a big issue like a massive oil leak, they will let you know and cover it if under warranty.\n\nJust keep in mind waiting times will be usually an hour sometimes two. Some dealerships will offer you a loaner vehicle that you can drive so you don’t have to wait.\n\nIf they tell you something is wrong like brakes, get a second opinion from a trusted mechanic or independent shop and get the service done, if not, the dealership can always do the service, although at a much higher labor rate and part price.\n\nThis is all honest advice I can provide you as a dealership service technician myself.",

Within the last 6 months, noticed a little oil leak under car, so when I brought it in for change, I had them check.\n\nThey said the oil pan is cracked, and offered to replace for $500-ish.\n\nI brought it back, took a look, and this is what I saw. No obvious crack anywhere, but metal is deformed. Am I wrong to think they overtightened the bolt and warped the metal around it? No damage to plastic cover over the pan, so at least in my mind, no way it could be damage from a pothole impact or something. They are the only shop to touch the drain plug in 3 years.\n\nI already replaced the pan myself, but I'm wondering if I need a new mechanic.",

It drives very well and has no other issues, but this sound seems indicative of a future problem, so hoping someone will have an input on it. Let me know if there’s any other testing I can do on it, thanks! ",

The car is driven daily and there were no complaints. FF to 5/5. They are driving to work and they send me a picture “charging system malfunction” and and bunch of shit on the dash. And I’m at work so unfortunately I’m unable to look myself, but I say “looks like alternator, but it could be a broken belt” they had the car towed to a shop and were charged 150$ for diag… broken belt. But I understand the game and that’s not my problem. They were quoted 450$ to have it replaced and I said I’d do it for them In a couple days. I change the belt, jump it, all good. On my way home they text me that the acceleration feels slow, so I just say to let it ride another couple days and I’ll check it out. Upon further inspection, the fuel rail sensor is unplugged and stuffed down way out of the way, I plug it in, problem solved. \n\nBefore I start pointing fingers, would you assume this is foul play or is it possible I missed it while completing the valve cover job? \nI wouldn’t think it’s something I missed especially since this complaint wasn’t brought up until after it was seen for the broken belt. \n\nSorry for the rant and I appreciate any feedback.

        "selftext": "Need help!\n\n2000 Honda CR-V\n\nI recently bought a used one after my Crown Vic transmission gave out.  Everything was going pretty good with it, fixed the brake lights, some burnt fuses, the distributor, spark plugs, etc. Then the timing belt broke but luckily I was going quite slow when it happened.  From talking to a bunch of CRV mechanics they said yes it’s technically interference, but in my case and in many it ends up being fine. I did the timing belt job myself over the course of 2 weeks and the timing all seems solid.  Did valve adjustment, new water pump, idler pulley, belts etc.  Had since been driving pretty well, save for a squeal on start up (alt belt slightly loose) and a slight whirring noise coming from the drivers side of the engine bay (possibly the power steering or fuel filter). \n\nLast week, I was doing about 30 when my acceleration gave out all of a sudden. I can start the car up, but I hear a kind of buzzing sound when shifting into park.  And there is no response from the throttle whatsoever in forward or reverse, just revving. I thought maybe the belt snapped but nope, after peeling the timing cover I see the belt is fine. Car starts so starter and battery should be fine…\n\nPlease help me!! I shelled out all my dough on this “legendary, reliable” CRV for it to break down on me in 2 very unfortunate ways. Was looking forward to having many memories in it, and I need to be able to get to work without inconveniencing my girlfriend by sharing her car!\n\nYour assistance would be so very much appreciated!!!!!!",

So I started torquing them to 80ft-lbs.\n\nThere was a post recently about over torqued lug nuts, but it was for a shorter period of time. \n\nI’m wondering if I should torque them to the recommended setting, or since it’s been a couple of years, keep torquing them to 110? (My reasoning is that if the threads were stretched or something like that, it could be better to keep it to the same torque 🤷‍♂️, I’m not a car person, don’t know if it even make sense).\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention it was for a Honda Civic 2018, so it’s been 6-7 years.

Metals do deform a very small amount under constant heat cycling and loading, called “creep.” But, even if the bolt or nut threads have moved at all under load then using the correct torque will always provide the stress that the engineers intended.\n\nIf, hypothetically, the bolts stretched a bit, then the nut would just turn an extra few degrees more to compensate. So, instead of 10 turns to be at 90lbft, it might take 10.5 or 11 turns. Don’t worry about it",

You weren’t torquing then to anything crazy. 110 is within reasonable torque specs for wheels. It’s unlikely you stretched a stud to the point where it’s gonna break down the line",

I crawled under there and took pictures, it looks like where the speed bump would have hit there is some bent up metal plates, kinda like under the exhaust. Does the drive train also rotate as the car is moving? bc maybe the metal pieces under the exhaust are just bent and being scraped by drive train rotation.\n\nSorry I know this post is really stupid but idk what else to do, I would really love to tell her 'hey honey funny thing ur car is not actually that messed up and what's better I fixed it for you with Reddits help' she's going to eventually figure out that I did this and I like having a girlfriend.\n\nattaching the pics I took, can go take more.",

When I start the car the engine sounds fine idiling... but when I start to drive it the engine sounds like it is locked in high gear.  I can even take my foot off the gas pedal and it will still continue to go 30mph.  I also notice the engine sputters after turning off the ignition.  This issue is recent and it  hasnt been happening with every ride but about 70% of time.  Does anyone have a possible diagnosis? Thanks",

I then disconnected the battery to see if the steering wheel would eventually budge, but to no avail. So after getting it towed home I ended up calling someone to fix everything that was damaged and the damage wasn’t too bad at all but even after the steering wheel is STILL locked but the security code question is gone from the screen. So if any one has any solutions let me know ASAP, I have work on Tuesday so if I can get this figured out by tomorrow that would be wonderful. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI drive a 2017 Hyundai Elentra SE with about 196k miles on it. Have had normal maintenance done on it and even replaced the timing chain around 120k miles or so. Car consumes a decent amount of oil but I NEVER run it dry. Constant topping off when filling up gas and just making sure its never too low.\n\nI have had a check engine light on for a while. As far as I know, the codes that were stored were a Bank 1 Sensor 1 code as well as an evap leak.\n\nToday while driving my car, my acceleration was acting sluggish. I would have to push extra hard on the pedal to make sure I was keeping up with the 70mph speed limit. Then, my check engine light started flashing. IMMEDIATELY, I pulled over on the side of the highway and had it towed and is awaiting the mechanics inspection on it tomorrow.\n\nI don’t have any videos of what the car was doing but it was trembling and I know this because I had to turn the car on once again to get it off the back of the tow truck once we arrived to the mechanic shop. \n\nFor some context, I had my valve cover gasket replaced along with my spark plugs and ignition coils roughly 3 months ago or so. So my question is, could one of the spark plugs really gone bad this quick? \n\nI do drive a lot and I tend to rack up miles pretty damn quick on this thing. Like I said, I know its hard to know exactly whats going on without a video, but I am open to potential ideas. I know enough about cars to have stopped immediately and did not drive further at all as I know that could cause catalytic converter damage and also engine damage overall. \n\nLike I said previously, my car constantly has oil in it and I even inspected the dipstick when I pulled over and the oil looked like a normal color. Also coolant was still in the reservoir so I am not aure what the issue could potentially be. \n\nHoping for some potential ideas maybe? Thank you all!",

That's easy to draw out and reason through, but kind of hard to explain.\n\nAnyway, you're probably getting water into a connector. They should all be sealed but evidently one isn't sealed well enough, and then water gets in and the resistance changes and throws the light. Maybe going through twice gets enough water in the connector to balance the two sides out.",

        "selftext": "I was driving back to SD from LA yesterday and was in the middle of bumper to bumper traffic. Wasn’t even going over like 15 mph probably and all of sudden the car jerked and I saw the transmission malfunction message. It also said “may continue to drive with limited capability” or something like that. It also said that the reverse gear wasn’t available. It was now showing me what gear I was in by the speedometer. Instead of just D for drive it said D1 and it would go to D3 and D5. Only odd numbers. When I would accelerate it wasn’t switching gears fast enough and same thing when I slowed down so it was jerking when going to lower gears. I immediately pulled over to the shoulder and shut off the engine. Googled the message and found a video on how to reset the transmission by holding down the gas pedal and turning on the car but not the engine and waiting 40 seconds then turning it off and on again. This seemed to work as the message was gone and it felt fine when I started driving again. Transmission felt like it was working good. After about 10 minutes of driving in slow freeway traffic it happened again. Luckily I was able to get off the freeway this time and I decided to do the reset again. The first time I did the reset I felt really rushed because of where I was on the side of the freeway. So I feel like I didn’t wait enough time before turning on the car again. But now that I was off the freeway and safely parked I did the reset again the correct way. And once again the message was gone and transmission felt good again. And I was able to drive another 30 minutes back home and everything felt smooth. I wasn’t trying to accelerate too much on the way home just in case it happened again. But like I said it felt good. But now the check engine light is on. Can this just be a sensor issue or something? I wanted to take it to Audi today but the service department is closed on Sundays and closed tomorrow for Memorial Day. Is this something I can diagnose myself or should I take it in to Audi on Tuesday? The car is only at 41,000 miles so this can’t be something serious or expensive I’m hoping.",

I had the valve body replaced in December and they had to remove the cover and replace the trans fluid, but I either didn’t notice a leak or it started in the last month or two.\n\nI’m aware that it could still be oil just leaking down, but that seems pretty far back to be motor oil. And it only being wet on the back is strange. I was hoping someone could help diagnose from the transmission pic and the paper towel wipe. The really dark dirt is likely from the road but there’s less dirty spots on the paper towel. Thanks, hope someone can help.",

        "selftext": "So, initially, my timing chain snapped years ago, causing me to have to replace it and my head. Has nothing to really do with it, but it sat for some time, like almost two years or so, before I actually got around to repairing it. When I did, the AC blew warm. I had already got a new car like a month after the timing chain snapped, so I was in no rush to look into the AC issue. It is a 2007 Saturn Ion-2 2.2 by the way\n\nAt one point, years later, my new cars AC started blowing warm. Long story short, I found a mechanic who wasn't trying to play me by making me believe the whole system needed to be replaced. Evacuated and recharged the system, and my ac blows cold til this day, going on the second year, although the dye he put in it shows there is a very slow leak somewhere, unfortunately\n\nI took the Saturn to him, and he did the same thing, and the AC was blowing cold again. I don't remember if he added dye to it tho. AC worked fine for months and months, and then one day, it stopped. I figured it had a slow leak somewhere. The next day, I drove it, it was back blowing cold and then eventually stopped again. I found that after the car has been parked for some time, and on cold starts, the AC would be back working again, but only for an hour to an hour and a half then shut off. I never found out why but I figured it ran low again because of the \"slow leak\", so I tried to self diagnose it using a manifold gauge and eventually decided to try and add refrigerant to the system sincethe psi was low on both low side and high side. This was a mistake, I guess. I heard a sound that resembled an air compressor when if gets the point of building up mac pressure, except not as loud and the hiss lasted a lot longer like when air runs completely out of a \"wheel\" gradually hissing less and less until all air is out.\n\nNow the ac won't blow cold at all. Did it over-pressurize? Before I attempted to add refrigerant, I pushed a screwdriver inside the schrader valve to release pressure from the system, so I'm not sure what happened.\n\nNow fast forward to a few days ago. I had a guy who says he has certificates or degrees or whatever\" diagnose\" the system. He works on a lot of people cars outside of a nearby Autozone. He's a mobile mechanic with a work van. He hooked up a single gauge to the high pressure line and said it was empty and that I needed to go in and purchase a can of refrigerant. He added the refrigerant and pointed out that the clutch wasn't engaging and said I needed a new compressor. The line line got really cold as he was adding refrigerant. He only attempted to add a little. I still have the 8oz can, which seems like it's still kinda full. When I tried adding it a long time ago, the line never got cold at all, yet all the freon emptied from the can!\n\nMy question is, how can he tell that the compressor needs to be replaced? A few days later, I hooked my scanner tool up to the OBDII port and found that there is a feature that allows for activating the compressor. When I click \"on,\" the clutch engages, but only for a few seconds. I'm assuming it's because it's designed to turn off due to low pressure from a leak or whatever to protect the compressor, correct? I honestly think I messed it up trying to add\n\nPlease share thoughts. \n\nThanks",

About a month ago, I had the oil level checked and it was fine.\n\nToday on the highway, I noticed the car was vibrating hard and I couldn’t get past 90 km/h. The check engine light came on. I pulled over and saw that the oil level was extremely low — almost nothing showing on the dipstick. I added oil right away (I didn’t notice any leaks under the car), but when I restarted the engine, it was vibrating badly and making a clicking or ticking noise.\n\nOver the next hour, I had to restart the car a few times to move it, and the noise and vibrations gradually went away. Now, it seems to be better.\n\nA mechanic will see the car tomorrow, but I’m scared he’ll tell me the engine is toast. Do you think the engine could still be okay? Or should I prepare for the worst?\n\n  \nThanks for taking the time of reading this",

Over the past month, her battery has died 4 times (twice this week). Each time after the car has been parked for multiple hours, but always well less than a day. After the 2nd time, I had the battery tested at AutoZone (they said it was good), I used a multimeter to verify there was enough voltage to charge the battery when the car was running, and I went through to make sure everything (lights and such) were turning off when the car was off and locked.\n\nSince then, I have tested for a parasitic draw and found nothing.  A mechanic friend of hers happened to have an extra unused battery he put in.  And then it happened again last night.\n\nNow here is something I thought was interesting...  According to her, when this happens, there is ZERO power in the car.  The key fob will not unlock it.  After manually unlocking it, the dome light does not come on, and when she puts the key in, there is no sound or lights on the dash.  \n\nThis seemed petty odd to me.  In my experience, even when a battery gets low, you will still see some signs of power, like dash lights.  \n\n  \nI'm wondering if this could be some sort of disabling feature in the car that is not unlocking.  Is that possible?",

Here are the ones I'm looking at (in cad) \n\nFCS AUTOMOTIVE - 1333386L - $172 \n\nWORLDPARTS STRUTS - W1333386L - $181 on sale (original $317) \n\nMONROE - 172709 - $196 \n\nMONROE/EXPERT SERIES - 172709 - $196 \n\nFCS AUTOMOTIVE - 1333503L - $177 \n\nThere are a few more options but these are the top ones that popped up. I will be buying for both sides since my passenger side will probably need a replacement soon too, but right now it's  just the driver side with the issue. Thanks in advance and any advice is appreciated.",

No repair necessary. \n\nEven if you could get the part, you can’t really fix it since A/C charging just isn’t a very DIY friendly endeavor. It requires some very specialized and expensive tools as well as refrigerant which should really only be handled by trained professionals. \n\nBut also… I’m not sure how much I trust their diagnosis in the first place. Refrigerant leaks aren’t really all that noticeable. The low pressure line is cold when the A/C is operating, therefore in humid environments, it drips with condensation from moisture in the air. That’s not a leak. It’s just water. \n\nI dunno what your issue really is, but you shouldn’t try to fix A/C stuff by yourself.",

        "selftext": "Quite a specific question to somebody who maybe repairs Automatic gearboxes.\n\nQuick summary - basically car does not go in reverse, when in \"R\" it seems like the transmission brake is on as RPM does no go above 2500RPM. Car goes forward, although sometimes slips, sometimes does not want to go above 3rd, sometimes just drops from 5-6th to 3rd underlight acceleration. \n\nAnd just to be clear - I know most economical solution, I have nice low mileage engine and gearbox in donor car and will swap it in shortly. I am just generally intrigued and want to understand what could cause such fault as I am interested to learn how it occurs, what causes it and how could one fix it, if let's say they can't get fully functional gearbox from donor car. \n\nJust for context and if somebody wonder how I got there... long story - I did engine swap on IS250 (4GR-FSE) from GS300 (3GR-FSE), perhaps weird outside of UK, but in UK we never got IS300, nor GS350... So even 3GR upgrade makes sense in UK. I had IS250 with very bad service history and what I suspected was engine wiring issue. The engine seemed alright to be fair (mechanically), but because we have access to dirt cheap GS300s I decided to do little bit of upgrade (that is 40HP increase across the rev range) and fit 3GR engine. \n\nThe engine and gearbox combo came from car with unknown service history, 140k miles, but it was perfectly functional, I drove for 6,000 miles in that car on trip to France, it shifted well and engine felt really healthy. Anyhow... when swapping the engine I noticed that oil pan on gearbox is totally busted, dented, rusted, leaking and there was no way that gearbox would have lasted with that oil pan, on top of being obvious failure for tech inspection. The thing is - I really dreaded touching gearbox, because I knew that at high miles and unserviced, these transmissions sometimes thorws a hissy fit if you touch ATF. Basically put new ATF in them and they just start acting weird. But in my case I really didn't have an option... either I had to replace oil pan or that transmission would have blown-up in 10k miles.\n\nSo I changed the oil pan, just drained all existing ATF into clean jar through paper filter put it into new oil pan added the amount that was missing (considering it was leaking for a while) and put it back in place. I though this mush have been least intrusive way from gearbox perspective. Engine stopped, pan came-off, another pan came-up, oil level got fixed, little bit of new ATF (\\~1.3L)... fingers crossed it still works...\n\nNope - it doesn't, initially it was slipping a little bit, I tough maybe it will be alright, new and oil AFT will mix-up and it will start behaving itself... and it sort of did. After 400 miles it stopped slipping, but then it started random downshift when just cruising up the hill, later it started not shifting past 3rd and eventually it lost reverse. At this point I kind of knew it means new gearbox, but I just tough - maybe I can do something about it... and one thing that particularly surprised me was that it was driving forward in neutral. So in my mind it had to be issue with valve body, stuck solenoid or valve... something obvious. And what I mean by drives forward in neutral - I mean there is literally no difference, you can put car in neutral and go on motorway cruise at 70MPH... cluster is kind of confused and shows the car is in N and does not show what gear it is in, but it shifts like it is in D.\n\nAt this point I was just interested and though - I can't make it worse so I may well just try to disassemble valve body and she if I can find something wrong with. Over last week I completely broke it apart cleaned everything, inspected all passages and found nothing really worth mentioning - little bit war and tear on some plugs, perhaps it would result in little bit of leak, but generally I would say it was relatively clean, no sludge, solenoids not blocked, even solenoid filters clean, there was little bit like black clutch material on surfaces and passages, but generally for 140k gearbox it looked great. So just cleaned everything, put everything together, put it back in the car. Made sure ATF level is perfect (did 3 cycles of top-up and level check). And it still does exactly same thing... maybe it slips little bit more now (considering that I now put 4.5L of new ATF on top of 1.3L previously, this gearbox pretty much have all new AFT now), but it does exactly same thing - drives in D and N, is completely stuck and rev limited in R.\n\nNow clutches slipping - that I understand... worn out clutches, loads of new ATF and they just don't lock-up properly. But this forward in neutral I just can't wrap my head around... it must be valve body issue... isn't it? But maybe some expert auto transmission wizard can explain me how and what causes such specific and weird issue? I would appreciate if somebody could shed some light on these magical creatures. ",

        "selftext": "Hello.\n\nI have a 2022 Mazda CX-30. Problems started a year ago when it just turned off in the middle of driving and I had to leave it at the side of the road because it wouldn't turn back on even with cables. I had to call to have it towed and they couldn't figure out what happened for more than 2 weeks. At the end they said that it was some rodent and they changed a fuse and that was it. A little bit less than a year later (April 2025) I went to the store and when I came back the car wouldn't start again. The lights turned on but the machine didn't start. I called the towing company again, they tried with the cables and it didn't work. They took it to certified Mazda workshop, they changed the fuse again. And then yesterday it happened again. Car wouldn't start and I had to get it towed again. I'm at a loss about what to do. I don't even feel safe driving anywhere because I am afraid it will bail on me. The car is always fixed at certified Mazda workshop and I have it parked in a garage. I would sell the car but I got it on leasing and need to pay the leasing for 4 more years. What should I do? I have no idea... If I complain to Mazda will they do anything? What is their customer service like? And where to even complain? What would you do?? Also we are from Europe, Slovenia if that changes a thing. Thank you so much for your help in advance.",

This should help you a little bit since your dealership and multiple mechanics haven't been able to figure it out.\n\nOther than that, you need to find a good mechanic that can truly diagnose the root cause issue..something else is popping your fuses in your electrical system, there has to be a problem somewhere. It would also help to explain to.him.which exact fuse keeps popping, and what codes appear on your scanner.

        "selftext": "Hi all,\nLooking for some help or insight from anyone who’s dealt with this kind of issue before…\n\nI’ve got a 2016 Citroën C1 semi-automatic, and I’m running into a weird fault. The car drives fine through the gears between 2nd and 5th, no issues there. However, when slowing down to a stop—especially around 1st gear or when crawling under 5mph—the car automatically shifts itself into neutral and then loudly beeps three times.\n\nIf I brake firmly and come to a complete stop, it usually flicks itself back into drive after a second. But if I don’t brake hard (e.g. just easing off the gas), it stays in neutral, even though the car is still in drive.\n\nTook it to my local garage and after much back and forth with the Citroën technical team, we decided the best course of action would be a new clutch. That’s now been done, but the issue is still happening.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar, especially with this gearbox or Citroën’s semi-auto system? Any help would be hugely appreciated before I start chasing it further (and spending even more!).\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "selftext": "**You can read my specific backstory below if you want context but skipping to the bottom for the TLDR is fine too!** Not really looking for comments specific to my case but a more general idea of what expectations should be. \n\nI know it depends on a lot of factors! I’m just thinking average shop with multiple mechanics that works 8 hrs/day weekdays. In my case I need voltage sensor/alternator/starter replacement (and starter is a bear in my 2012 civic), but I’m sure you could imagine similar situations where it’s a few different parts that need to be sourced and replaced and maybe at least one is obnoxious/involved. \n\nI dropped it at a one-man shop with rave reviews. I think he was unusually busy and weather was a challenge, but I had to be up his ass to even get the diagnosis (didn’t even look at the car until 2 days after he said he would) and then a week after that he had a new diagnosis and estimated another week before I could have the car back (and at that point I was very skeptical about his time estimates). The price wasn’t bad but he was also going to use rebuilt parts and 2 weeks w/o a car in the US seemed extreme for me. \n\nI tried shopping around but he didn’t actually get the final diagnosis to me until Friday so by that time everywhere else was shutting down for the weekend. Most shops wouldn’t even look at it for another week but one said they’d get it done next day. So I took it to them and again, they didn’t even get me the diagnosis until I called them even though they said they would call me, and it was very clear they’d had the diagnosis for awhile and just hadn’t called me for whatever reason. By that time of course it was too late in the day to order parts and because of the long weekend, at minimum 3 more days without the car being drivable (that’s what they told me, but by this point I was skeptical). \n\nI’m out over $250 in diagnostics now. I called the OG guy again and understandably lost my spot in line, and he said he couldn’t even look at the car for another week and the fix would take another week after that. Total 3 weeks no car. \n\nI plan to call my regular shop when they open that I like a lot—they’ve been closed each time I needed to reach them. I think I’ll be more certain when they give me the estimate because of my good experiences with them in the past. I guess I’m just wondering if this is normal? In the past I’ve gotten car repairs done in at most 2 days, and the shop has called me to give diagnostics and update me on the status of the car. But I’m a younger adult and do a lot of the basics myself, almost always  with my husband’s help and advice (his dad does car stuff for a living), so I’m not really that familiar with what my expectations for what these timelines should be. I got AC replaced in a day last year, knock sensor that would have been replaced in a day except I brought the wrong part so it took 2 but that was my own fault. I guess those aren’t comparable though really to alternator/voltage sensor/starter. \n\nI can’t imagine most people just have their cars in the shop for a week or multiple weeks? This is incredibly stressful and I luckily work from home—if I had to commute idk how we’d make it for more than a day or two. I’m wondering if I’ve just been unlucky with the timing of when the problem started (weekend, then long weekend) and how much that limited my options for who I could take it to. \n\n**tl;dr: Is it normal for mechanics not to look at your car for 5+ calendar days and not update you for multiple days on it once you bring it in?**\n",

Recently my car (2009 toyota corolla) started making this screeching . whimpering noise every time I drive slow, however they silence when I press on the brakes. I took them to a mechanic and he told me that all my brakes are fine, and that the noise is because the rear drums and brake shoes are diluted from the weather. It recently did rain heavily but it has been sunny for about 3-4 days now, and the noise has not gotten away. I tried to ask him if he is sure and that my car has never made this noise before after rain and he kept telling me that there is nothing to worry about and that is just from the rain. I don't know much about cars but my gut tells me that this can't be right. Thoughts?",

Just earlier today the same thing happened today and i scanned it n these codes came up. just now realized tho when typing it out that the camshaft sensor and crankshaft sensor are NOT the same thing lmao. for some reason that just clicked. Should i begin with replacing that sensor, also heard that it could show up because of dirty oil. I’m very new to working on cars, so i’m just looking for some guidance. How does this oil look and what are your opinions? ",

And I would like to avoid replacing expensive parts that don't need to be replaced.\n\nThanks in advance for any help or direction you can offer!",

        "selftext": "I'm hearing some loud clicking from the front right when turning sharply, especially at low speeds. I've also noticed when going around 45+ mph, when turning the wheel even slightly to the left or right, there are some bumpy noises/sounds, mostly from the front left. I don't hear/feel them at all when the wheel is kept completely straight though. I'm not sure if those two things are the same issue or not.\n\nI did some research and found that at least the first issue is a common sign of a faulty cv axle, so I tried to take a look under the car and found this. Does it look like this cv axle has popped out of the transmission a bit? If so, is this something that I could potentially just pop back in, or would I need to get the entire cv axle replaced? And for the second issue, since I am mostly noticing the sounds from the front left at higher speeds, is that a sign that the left cv axle has an issue too or could it be something else?\n\nAny help/input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

                "body": "So turns out that even I don't know what the fuck is that sound but as much as I know, according to my knowledge base, you should first change all the fluids in the vehicle as that thing has been sitting for like 4 years straight and in a farm house. So a fluid change in required and try listening to the oil pump which is usually located beneath the back passenger seat, let your cars fuel line be pressured and try hearing the humming sound of the pump in that time, if you don't hear it, you need a new pump which costs around 50-60 dollars max. See the timing belt, check if it is aligned correctly. This is not because the car was sitting, but because it's not starting. Try checking the starter of your car, is it powerful enough and cranking  as much as it should? If no, you need a starter. Try removing the old fuel from your car and putting in fresh new gas ⛽ for it to drink as there are a huge number of reasons the fuel is causing this. Try checking your intake vents, is it clogged? If yes then clean the intake and clean the airfilter so that the engine can have the correct air pressure for the car to start. Start revving the car as soon as it starts so that if it doesn't idle or is just not warm enough yet, it would get fixed upon revving. And for the noise, all I can say is that is probably the starter which is held loose cause the power steering wheel motor won't make a sound like that and that's because the sound is coming from/near the steering and dashboard near the steering. If all of these don't work, you would require a mechanic to check each of your individual spark plugs and check if the injectors are working properly or no because checking the injectors require special tools and cannot be checked with homemade tools until your willing to spend 40+ dollars on portable  injector checkers. Your mechanic will also check in if your system is making the correct mixture of air, fire(spark) and fuel because if this is misaligned, the system is very likely to not start. The crank shaft however needs to be examined as said by the computer dashboard and the dashboards kinda seems to be gaslighted as it is like wtf is happening man, it seems glitchy and I think. There are more errors than just that one, you will need a service error code reader for more details and proper examination.\n\n\n\n\nHENCE THE CONCLUSION, your car is beyond self repair and just needs to be checked by a mechanic. You can post about the mechanic's reaction to the car with the cost he is saying and the things he thinks are at fault on reddit and tag me in it, I will help you there and let you know if he is doing good or trying to steal money.

I am not sure but maybe torque vectoring is wrong? I don't know but for sure after hearing that sound for one more time, I am darn sure it's not the starter motor but something that is getting affected by the starter motor as in just as the starter motor gives power, the sudden power triggers something on and whatever that thing is, it only turns on when the engine is on as much as I know, it won't turn on while on battery mode. The guess is the noise has something to do with the power steering.",

New clutch was done 1.5 years ago by the dealer under warranty.  I did rear brakes about 6 months ago and front brakes 3 months ago.  Started noticing the noise after front brake job.  I took it all apart yesterday, removed the pad bracket and cleaned it all out, applied lube and put back together.  Still making the noise.  Attached video so you can hear the noise.  Thanks.  ",

So in March I took my car into the Hyundai service department after noticing some oil on the ground and they diagnosed and “fixed” the problem - saying it was a rear main seal leak that was replaced. \n\nAbout a month later I noticed oil AGAIN and brought it back, they admitted it was the same problem and again replaced the rear main seal. \n\nOnce again, after only having my car back for 2 weeks, I see oil leaking in the same spot. \n\nNot sure what to do at this point. The fixes have been under warranty but I’ve been left carless for weeks as I’m only 23 and they won’t give out loaners until 25. Also tired of the same problem happening on a fairly new car. Doesn’t even have 30,000 miles on it yet. \n\nAny advice is appreciated, thanks!\n\n",

Ended up cutting the cable just long enough to get pliers on it from the front of the car.  Also just a FYI, never going back to Midas, mounted parts that aren't even for my model and zip tied the ACC sensor to the frame.  Guessing they didn't know how to mount it I have no fucking clue?",

I changed the pads, but they were only about half way worn. I didn't disconnect the caliper from the brake line so didn't need to bleed it. \n\nNow, it occasionally loses pressure in the brake pedal, pedal goes down to the floor and car braking is much less. Occasionally isn't very often, but still doing it. It isn't scraping anymore but I've heard slight grinding once or twice. \n\nWould a stuck caliper cause these issues (brake fade on all 4 wheels, scraping similar to wear indicators and slight grinding with new pads,) or am I looking at a possible master cylinder issue?",

When I started the car, I let it warm up for a couple of minutes like I always do. I pulled away gently in first gear, and when I shifted into second, I heard a loud *bang* from the front and the car lost all power. At first there was no smoke or anything. I turned the engine off and took a look under the hood but didn’t see anything obvious.\n\nWhen I tried starting it again, it began smoking heavily from the exhaust and went into a \"runaway.\" Luckily, the 105s has a throttle shutoff valve for situations like this, so I managed to stop it in time. I haven't tried starting it again since.\n\nI had it towed home, and it turns out the turbo shaft snapped. This is the first time I’ve had a turbo failure like this, and I wanted to ask: **besides replacing the turbo, what else should I do before trying to start the car again?**\n\nI've been told to remove and clean the intercooler, but is there anything else I should check or clean to avoid damaging the engine?  \nThanks in advance!",

        "selftext": "Have a 2000 dodge pickup 1500 that started having problems about 3 years ago, it would howl and shake when driven. Took it to a mechanic that said it was the front differential. Got the front diff opened and there was little wear on the gears and a little metal in the oil. He replaced the oil and said it should be fine. That didn't fix it, I left it alone for a year or so (bad idea), the howling got worse and it started slipping out of 4wd and now won't engage at all. I opened the differential again only to find dirty oil, no metal. Couldn't use it during the winter because of the no 4wd, went to use it for the first time since last fall, it's having trouble going into drive and reverse and now there's a red leak coming from the transmission pan. \n\nNow I'm just confused. I know leaving the problem and still driving it was a bad idea but no mechanics near me could figure out the problem. Could it just have been low transmission fluid causing all of that. That would explain the transfer case and drive/reverse not working. Or could it still be the front differential causing some problems, maybe not the gears but another part. Or maybe both? I just need my truck for work and no mechanic near me (there are only 2 but the closest mechanic other than them are 1 hr 30 mins away) can figure it out. Is there anything else that could be causing howling, gear slip, and 4wd slip. \n\n\nEdit: I checked the atf level. It’s over max by at least half an inch. Don’t know when that happened haven’t added atf since I’ve had it (about 5 years). That definitely could have caused the leak but I don’t know about the other symptoms. ",

        "selftext": "So my 2011 Toyota Sequoia Limited 4WD V8 has had this issue for quite awhile now where the trunk's lid latch wont close on the D-Ring like its supposed too. I have tried everything I can think of, l've checked any and all fuses, made sure that there wasn't anything obstructing the latch, and replaced the entire latch mechanism with both OEM and aftermarket (new and used) parts and nothing has worked so far. I'm pretty sure at this point its an electrical issue but I don't have the faintest clue on where to even begin on fixing that. All I can say for sure is that the motor on the latching mechanism is never able to reset the latch when I close the trunk I have to manually reset the latch to get it to close properly. it will however unlatch just fine when I go to open it like normal.",

Today after a few short trips it starts not being able to idle and will bog out. Only the CEL came on(no vsc or !) and no codes. It’s trying to start today about 3 times and does but can’t idle. Checked fuel pump resistor and it’s testing fine and isn’t overly hot. I did a smoke test with car hot and cold and no leaks were found. Could this be fuel pump? Fuel pump relay seems to work as the pump will prime and the car will run if I press the gas. Is there a relay that switches from the fuel pump resistor and full power to fuel pump? Any ideas are welcome",

But DPF are basically wear items: they will need replacement at some point. Yes, manufacturers say it's one of those items that should \"last the life of the vehicle\" but forget to mention the life of the vehicle for them is 100.000km or less. Again generally speaking DPF and small diesel engines are a bad idea, and we are starting to see the first GPF (particulate filters for GDI engines) in need of replacement. Again \"they last the life of the car\".\n\nIf you can still drive them where you live and want a diesel, get an old Volkswagen TDI with unit injection (Pumpe Düse). More reliable, much easier to diagnose, much cheaper to fix, parts are not a problem and there's a ton of knowledge out there.",

Should I fix the car or sell it first? The dilemma is because I was planning on selling the car soon as I'm moving states and just need a vehicle for the next 2-3 months before the move. Is it worth it to fix the car so it's able to work for the few months I need it and sell it right before I leave, or should I sell it now and get another car (buy or maybe rent?) for the next few months?\n\n Im trying to do the math on what would be the most cost saving but looks like I'm f***ed either way.

It also seems to happen when going over slight bumps. It doesn't happen very often, and I have no idea how to recreate it. It was happening more over the winter, and I thought it went away, but it just happened again last night.\n\nMy guess is a ground somewhere, or maybe a bad ECU or something.

I'm wondering if it is possible to tack apart the PCM without damaging it and replace the pin.I'm fairly good with repairs but I'm concerned that there may be a mechanism that will wie the computer if it is tampered with. Also, does anyone know where I can find a wire diagram/pin out for the PCM?",

No matter what I do, the heater just will not blow hot air or even warm air when the engine is up to temperature. I checked the coolant temperature in the secret menu and it was not overheating. But I’ve seen this symptom before on an old Pontiac I used to have. The heater not working is a sign of a very serious issue. The intake manifold gasket was blown on it and that was what caused the heat not to work. I’m thinking it could be a blown head gasket if there is air leaking into the cooling system because BMW is notorious for blown head gaskets",

If i turn the key, no lights come up in the dashboard.\n\nThe battery on the car was recently changed by the previous owner, and i drove the car without any issues. I parked the car for 3 days, came back to it without battery. Ive inspected the battery, and the terminals look clean and whole. Cables look good too.\n\nI suspect i forgot to turn the stereo off, its not original to the car and i know some people might hook it up directly to the battery(?), But then again i dont know. theres no subwoofer or extra sound equipment.\n\nI dont have any tools and very little money until august and I need to get the car fixed ASAP. Im buying jumpercables tomorrow to hopefully drive the battery full again, but im concerned the battery is getting drained by something else than the stereo.\n\n  \nPlease help me",

It does not appear that the left side has a separate motor, and is run off this turning rod.  \n\nso i'm thinking there's a stripped gear somewhere and rod is spinning freely.  staring at front seat assembly parts diagrams has my head spinning.  i can't seem to find a diagram that shows the rod and gear assembly for the left side seatback recline.  \n\ni've seen a TSB for same gen previous years about noisy recline. no noise issue, just half locked in place.  \n\nany help in identifying the part number  and how to replace that contains that left side gearing is appreciated.",

So it's apparently a physical connection issue of some kind (either intermittent connection or loose wires/loose plug)\n\nI watched a couple Youtube videos on installing these all-in-one seatbelt kits but none of the videos mention whether or not special \"programming\" is needed for this kind of all-in-one kit - usually the video just ends right after they finish installing the part. The various Youtubers I watched seemed to imply it's just \"plug and play\" but I wanted to double-check to be safe\n\nObviously I would disconnect the battery before replacing, I know that much at least\n\nThe idea I had in mind was going down to the junkyard and simply pulling a used OEM seatbelt retractor kit and then installing it in my own car to finally clear the B0081-71 for good.

My hatch latch is done for, it no longer latches (I used to be able to manually latch and unlatch it a few times and it'd then latch). I'm trying to find the part that contains the actual metal latch that grabs the striker to lock it, because it's not the motor or anything I believe. But the part coming up in search for a generic doesn't look like it has a latch for that bar to go into? On the OEM site, the parts looks to be GN1Z-5426413-C, but the included sc is what comes up as an option. Red circle is the confusing generic, blue arrows look like the diagram, it also looks like that generic is just a part of the other mechanism on other options so I'm lost.\nAny advice or guidance is really appreciated, or any advice to get it to shut again for good too. I can't afford to get the whole assembly or take it in because the dealerships are too expensive. Thank you ",

With struggle I finished the job. I cranked the engine by hand two revolutions and it spun, but very tough. When I went to start the vehicle it sounded bad. Like timing jumped or something. Turned it off immediately and flat towed to the shop. I told the shop that I had concerns about the sprocket, and the timing. I explained everything. With each call I asked if they checked the sprocket and they said no. \n\nThe first call, they tell me it needed to be timed. \nThe second call, they’ve timed it, it’s running, but it’s overheating. \n\nNext thing I know I’m being handed a 2500 quote for a timing rebuild. \n\nThey still hadn’t checked the sprocket. But the water pump wasn’t spinning when they had pulled it to find that the gears were messed. \n\nThe old pump still spins, the new pump spun just fine with my hands before install. \n\nI’m not entirely sure whether those barely 5 seconds could have caused this. \n\nI need to know I’m not being crazy, because I am not paying 2500$ for this if it wasn’t my fault.\n\nWould they not have noticed if the gears were fcked BEFORE they ran it till overheating?!",

Which sprocket? And, what do you think might be wrong with it?\n\nAlso, when you say, \"... noticed if the gears were fck..\", what gears are you talking about? Is your water pump gear driven?\n\nI think you might be best off if you visited the shop and asked them to show you the damage, so you might get a better understanding.\n\nThat's a pretty big bill, but it isn't that far out of line.

I asked Ai and it says could be a faulty alternator, slipping serpentine belt? - My belt has been squeaking since I bought it and everything else was working fine, ECU or voltage regulator issues?

Check if there's transmission fluid in the coolant: if there's any stop driving the car right now until it's fixed. If you have no transmission issues yet you can probably get away with a new radiator (more on which in a minute), new coolant and a transmission fluid change. If the transmission starts misbehaving due to water contamination, it's done for. \n\nOn the other side if you just have a mysterious disappearance of coolant, check the \"valley plate\" between the two cylinder banks and the very top of the radiator. They are the typical leak locations on this car, with the plate being by far the worst.\n\nIn all their genius, Toyota decided to cool the ATF by having a single metal line pass through the bottom of the radiator: that line succumbs to corrosion and slowly but surely coolant with drain into the transmission and ATF will drip into the coolant. If you haven't done it already consider installing a standalone transmission cooler mod kit: it's about the best investment that can be done on this car.",

Just a visual lookabout and a few pokes with a screwdriver?  Disassemble and see what breaks, and call it quits when the domino effect of replacing all the parts pushes the cost beyond the budget?\n\n\nThe situation:\nThere's a decent sized rough spot in one of the brake disks that causes vibrarion on braking - so I'm looking to do new disks and calipers.  Trouble is some of the bolts I'll need to pull aren't in good shape, and I suspect more than a couple wont come out without a fight that is likely to result in collaterage damage.\n\nIt's entirely possible the vehicle as a whole is on it's last legs, and I'd be better off finding a replacement than doing the brakes.  \n\nBut it'd be nice if I could make that determination *before* I sink time and money into fixing things, preferably with minimal dismantling.\n\n**So, what would you check?  What would you not want to see?**\n\nN.B.: The car runs and handles well.  Aside from some vibration on applying the brake, there's been no change in handling or stopping distance, no alignment or suspention issues, no noises, rattles, sqeals, gurgles, drips, smoke, smells, etc.  Body is in good shape, no exhaust leaks, no dangling/dragging parts, no check engine light, etc. Even gets decent milage.\n",

There's a lot more labor and way more hardware parts that should be replaced or cleaned carefully if not - (multiple springs on each side as well as keepers, brackets, star wheel adjusters and other things). \n\nThe drum itself is probably a small cost in the midst of all that labor. It's not uncommon to be replaced since most shops don't have the machine to resurface them and remove a ridge that can make reassembly difficult like they used to but I wouldn't say it's a system that requires it.\n\nStill, if you don't trust your mechanic then take it to someone else and get their assessment of condition and price estimate.",

I'm approaching 100K miles so I guess it's not that far fetched to need it done. Would love to get by on just replacing the shoe in this situation (financially speaking) 😆",

                "body": "Like anything, it depends. Much like disk brakes, eventually you would need to replace the pads and the rotors. Since they both wear down over time. Same thing for drum brakes, eventually the shoes will wear down the drum as well and will need to be replaced eventually. This is going to be mileage and use based rather than time based. Really getting in there and measuring the thickness of those various components will tell you whether it truly needs it. \n\nA quick amazon check shows... $170 for drums and shoes (and it looks like bearings as well). So if you're DIY'ing, that isn't bad at all considering just how important the braking system is.\n\nFor shop costs, as mentioned, drums are \\*far\\* more annoying that discs to service. If the shop doubles the parts cost, and then charges $200 an hour labor... I could see how you hit $1k fairly easily. Not sure what the book is for that, but 2 hours wouldn't surprise me.  The braking system is \\*the\\* most important part of your car (functionally), more important than the motor. So make sure it's done right (either by you or a mechanic)",

Took it to the dealership (I do not like maintaining gearboxes with non-OEM parts), said that the fluid was in typical condition of its age, reset its parameters and told me to come back if it’s acting up again.\n\nDrove like brand new for a while, but now it’s acting up again! Symptoms are: rough jerk when getting into gear (D or R), occasional bang/thud when downshifting from 6th at speed, when accelerating it sometimes likes to hang/throw its revs up before it eventually shifts up.\n\nCurious if there’s a technique that I can use to do a proper drain and fill, since diluting contaminated fluid with fresh fluid still makes it contaminated.",

Then the battery light came on the dash after a while. The next day, the digital display on the dashboard and the power steering turned off for a few seconds and came back on. This happened 2-3 times. \n\nI finally got time on Saturday to look into this. What I found was the left tail light doesn’t turn on with the left blinker nor with the hazard lights on. But it lights up when the headlights are on. (There are two filaments in the bulb). So it looks like the filament inside is for the blinker and hazard, which doesn’t light up,  and the filament outside is for the headlight which lights up. \n\nI tested the battery with the car off and running and running with load. The voltage readings are normal for all three cases. There was a good bit of white-green corrosion powder on the red terminal cable so I disconnected the battery and cleaned it up. \n\nAnd after that, it’s gotten worse. Now when driving, the fan, radio and power steering keep turning off for a few seconds and comes back on. And there was a rapid clicking noise one time as well. And the battery light is still on. \n\nI can’t figure out what’s the issue since the battery voltage readings are normal. \nIs the battery light on the dash - the faulty interior  electricals - the left blinker issue all connected or are they two separate issues? \n\nPlease help me diagnose this. I have a Forscan tool with the software that I just bought. \n\n\n\n\n",

I just had the clutch checked over because I had an issue changing gears and it was fine (car has only done 30,000 miles) and i had my actual clutch pedal replaced because it wasn’t disengaging(?) which was causing the gear change problem. again i’m not the best with cars so i hope this all makes sense.",

        "selftext": "The rear axle on my 2003 F150 was sort of noisy (whine).  Mechanic initially replaced the pinion bearing that did not fix it.  So, they installed a reman rear axle assembly.  They drove it around some to check after install and then I took it home.  Used the truck on some errands the next day OK.\n\nThe day after, I hitched up my 18' car trailer and noticed the parking brake was too loose and not holding.  So, I looked under there to see if it was a easy fix.  While doing that, I saw gear oil leaking from the pinion seal.  NOTE this was after towing that trailer for about 10 miles.\n\nTook the truck back and they replaced the seal.  Again, they drove it a bit and then I drove it home.  Drove it to work the next 2 days and checked for leaks each time.  Seemed OK.  It would have had about 100 miles in that time.  Not towing though and not more than 18 miles of lite driving.\n\nSo, hitched up trailer again for a planned road trip.  At 30 miles in I had to stop for pit stop and took a look under the truck.  Lube is leaking again!!  Had to decide whether to turn around or press on.  I had packed some gear oil just in case and could get more at my destination so pressed on.\n\nEnd of the trip \\~200 miles from home and looking at the pinion area it does not look like it kept leaking the entire distance.  Either its low now or stopped leaking?\n\nI had mentioned to the mechanic when I took it back if it was possible the vent was clogged somehow or if the flange had a burr to damage the seal.  They did say they checked the flange but I don't know about the vent.  I am planning to check that out now myself.\n\nIs there some other reason this could have started to leak??  I am getting that more distance or pulling a load is going to heat up the assembly more than short trips and maybe that is the factor?",

It burns oil at idle, but have not noticed anything on cold startup, both cold and warm starts, or while running. Sometimes it immediately starts with blue smoke at idle, sometimes it takes a few minutes. I don't wanna just start ripping into it and throwing parts at it. Previous owner put anti foulers on it to try to keep from ruining plugs. I'm thinking possibly valve stem seals. Would a compression test suffice, or should I do a leak down test?

        "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI have an 03 2.4l v4 automatic Galant which has normally driven fine. Unfortunately, she's hit hard times. At a stop sign, I usually have to accelerate pretty damn fast from 0 to 50 mph in order to enter traffic. Recently, I attempted that turn and the car just stopped accelerating. There were no check engine lights or terrible sounds, the engine just revved down and ignored my input. It wasn't until I let off the throttle that it actually began producing power. Trying that same turn again and flooring it up a hill produced the same result.\n\nThere are no engine codes or lights, besides a small evap leak code I've had for months now (I'm pretty sure it's from a bad gas cap). I've checked the TPS which seems perfectly fine. Transmission fluid is good, oil level is good, etc... Oddly enough, after the first incident I drove it around elsewhere and the car shifted fine, so it's either intermittent or because I accelerated more gradually then.\n\nI'm currently considering the secondary catalytic converter the culprit, though I lack the experience to be sure. Signs pointing towards it are a tin can like rattling emanating from underneath when stopped, which I've dutifully ignored for months, and a flatlined voltage (.02v) on what I believe is the O2 sensor after that cat. Though, I'm not sure why the computer wouldn't be picking that up itself.\n\nIf anyone with more car oriented braincells can point me in a direction, I'd really appreciate it. ",

        "selftext": "Hello all.\n\nI am trying to figure out how to flash an ecu on a 1999 dodge ram 2500 auto 4wd 5.9L.\n\nIve opened the bad ecu and alot of the capacitors leaked out onto everything bricking the ecu. I've got a newer 2002 ecu per advise that they have better quality electrolytic components. Just needs flashed with drbiii.\n\nIve purchased a Micropod 2 clone and have enhanced drbiii emulator working and running on an old windows 7 laptop. Do i absolutely need a techtools login to get the correct flash file for my truck or can i purchase an 2004 drbiii dvd off ebay and upload somehow? Read online that the drb dvds might not have cummins flash files on them.   \n\n\nAny advise would be really appreciated. ",

It appears after around 10 minutes of driving and goes away if I turn on the AC, but returns as soon as I turn the AC off.\n\nFrom the engine bay, it appears to be coming from the front left area where the radiator is. I tried recording it but my phone cant pick up the noise over the engine idling noise.\n\nShould I take it back to the garage?",

Personally I call it \"YouTube pricing\" or \"This is why smoking crystal meth is not a good idea\".\n\nAnd yes, these people are really conviced their car/truck/motorcycle is worth that much money. People on the Internet keeps on telling them they sold theirs for that much and there's this YouTuber who buys cars from old folks for peanuts and resell them for a fortune... Example I know well.\n\nThere was a very robust attempt to turn Japanese sportsbikes from the turn of the century into \"sleeper classics\" (a term I hate with a burning passion) or \"modern classics\". Prices went crazy in 2021-2023: I personally know of a Honda SC44 (CBR929RR for the US market) sold for €23.000. Then the market died overnight as people realized to their horror they were just buying mass produced stuff nobody wants and they were just flipping bikes among themselves. Now an SC44 in perfect conditions, low km etc. has an asking price of just €2.200 but you can probably get it to under €2.000: these are the same folks who bought those bikes for crazy prices and spent a fortune to restore them as Honda stopped supporting them around 2010. They lost the proverbial shirt and the government doesn't care so there's no bailout or tax writeoff here. Yet.",

Replaced as an assembly, could be a few hundred bucks, say 300ish?. Hour of labor to install (@149/hr our shop rate) I could see that being ~450ish.\n\nOuter tie rod end would probably run around $80-100 for the part, probably another hour install (reality: about 15-20min, but most shops charge a minimum of 1hr).\n\nAlignment for 120 is fair, shops around here range 99-139 for them.\n\nI could probably price this job around 7-800 including Alignment and tax. This is just pricing off the top of my head, and not calculating taxes or knowing their labor rate.\n\n\nIf you want to DIY, I won't try to stop you, but you will want to get a professional alignment afterwards. You can probably get the parts and do it over a weekend for about 300-500. Assuming you have tools, the jobs are fairly basic.",

It seems like the back brakes are the issue. Should i have a look and just grease where necessary, or is it fine to replace just the back discs and pads. Ideally id want to return the front set as I havent used them, but want a mechanic opinion. Its only £150 id get back for the front set, and the rear is roughly £110 (im not choosing the cheapest of course).\nCheers\nEdit - if it's better to replace the front too then i will. The discs have clearly seen a few sets of pads on the front given the slight lip. I can see the rear have a lip too. Wpuld it be better to replace the front pads wven though they have plenty of life with the new discs if that were the route to go down?",

You could also get some \"disc brake quiet\" or equivalent product to put on the back of the pads between the pad and the caliper, to absorb the vibrations that can make noise.  If it works, you have saved some money.  If not, or if things are worn to where it's time to replace them, then order the parts and replace as needed.\n\nOnce the back are are sorted, if you still have noise then I suppose it is probably time to do the front as well.",

Currently reconnecting the heater in my ancient landcruiser which means I’m improvising as all the hoses are no longer being produced. I made the mistake of assuming everything was 18mm when I ordered the hoses but it looks like I’ll need to reduce it to 16mm in a few places. Any thoughts?\n\nI’m currently thinking  I’ll either a) need to track down some 18 to 16 connectors and splice a few short lengths of hose to get the reduction, or b) I’m quite tempted to just grab some self amalgamating tape to wrap the connections and increase their effective diameter to 18mm.\n\nKeen to hear some suggestions from the hive mind before I proceed.

Maybe about 7 hours? My neighbor called my parents about it who called me and told me to start my car because they thought it might be dead.\n\nThe car's not new, but when we bought it our mechanic put in a brand new battery last November. Car turned on fine. Haven't driven it yet. But their anxiety is becoming mine and now i'm worried the battery will die any day now.\n\nI know batteries tend to last 3-5 years depending and having the low lights, not the actual headlights, on for 7 hours isn't going to instantly kill the battery, but i need people who know more than me to tell me. TIA",

        "selftext": "Hello all\n\nCivic mk8 1.8 r18 2007, manual. \n\nJust changed my fuel filter with an OEM replacement. I followed the instructions to the T!\n\nHowever after putting everything together again, my car just will not start. Cranks but the engine isn't turning over.\n\n- I've checked the inertia switch. Nothing.\n\n- I've checked the fuel pressure regulator, it's correctly inserted\n\n- I've checked the connection within the fuel filter, all good\n\n- When I turn the ignition to II, I can hear the fuel pump click and making a humming noise\n\n- There's over a quarter tank of petrol\n\nThe only thing I've noticed is afterwards, I checked the fuel lines and they are completely dry, so there's no fuel being sucked up from the tank\n\nHas the pump failed? Is there a vacuum leak?\n\nThe car was working perfectly before I replaced the fuel filter\n\nPlease help, I'm at a loss. Was meant to be a straightforward service but has turned into a 4 day ordeal. Thank you in advance",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’m dealing with a serious issue with my car — a 2020 Nissan Terrano (automatic transmission) with a StarLine A93 alarm system with remote start installed.\n\nWhat happened:\n\t•\tToday, the alarm started going off by itself — siren and hazard lights activated for no reason.\n\t•\tI disconnected the battery to stop the noise.\n\t•\tAfter reconnecting the battery:\n\t•\tThe car stopped responding to the remote,\n\t•\tDoors won’t lock/unlock,\n\t•\tWindows don’t work,\n\t•\tAnd the engine won’t start at all.\n\t•\tThe head unit also shows a message like “Enter authenticity code” (probably OEM theft protection after power loss).\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n\t•\tI found what seems to be the VALET button, integrated into the StarLine antenna on the windshield.\n\t•\tTried entering the emergency PIN:\n\t•\tReconnected the battery → turned ignition on → pressed the button 1, 2, or 3 times.\n\t•\tNothing worked — siren keeps blaring, engine is still immobilized.\n\t•\tThe StarLine remote doesn’t work (maybe unpaired).\n\t•\tI’ve decided I want to completely remove the StarLine system, but haven’t physically accessed the module yet.\n\nMy goal:\n\nI want to fully remove the StarLine A93 system to:\n\t•\tStart the car again,\n\t•\tDisable the engine block,\n\t•\tEliminate false alarms and any future issues.\n\nQuestions:\n\t1.\tHas anyone dealt with something like this? Is there a way to reset or disable StarLine A93 without the remote, if the PIN is unknown?\n\t2.\tHow can I properly disable the engine block? Where is the block relay usually installed on a Nissan Terrano?\n\t3.\tAfter removing the alarm system, is it safe to just reconnect the cut wires (e.g. starter/fuel pump) and keep driving normally?",

Frankly this quote pissed me off so much I tore apart the upper intake myself that evening. \n\nTook about 4 hours as I also deleted the smog system and inspected the EGR system when I discovered broken vacuum lines hidden inside the sleeves. No vacuum from the vacuum tree was making it to the reservoir. \n\nTried to fix it with shrink wrap, but it's not a good solution, so I ordered 20 feet of 4mm rubber tubing to replace every single vacuum line in the engine bay. \n\nJesus, Ford.

                "body": "There are no street legal retrofit LED bulbs and there's a reason for that. It's optically impossible for a retrofit LED bulb to produce the proper beam pattern when placed into a headlight designed for halogen, and that include projector headlights as well. The LED light source is completely different than a halogen. It's flat instead of cylindrical. It's a different size. It's in a different spot. It casts light 270° instead of 360°. So, while they appear brighter than a halogen, it's because they produce more glare. That actually put less light on the road than a halogen bulb and more glare into oncoming traffic. The optics of a projector headlight are more complicated than a reflector headlight. The reflector in a projector headlight much perfectly match the bulb it was designed for. If not, it won't reflect light into the right spot in front of the lens. [This article](https://ricksfreeautorepairadvice.com/retrofit-led-headlight-bulbs-why-they-dont-work/) shows diagrams of how light travels in a halogen headlight when you replace with an LED bulb. Scroll down toward the bottom of the article and you can see why they can't possible produce the right beam pattern.",

I tested the voltage reading of the pump with two different EFI relays and both times it read zero (while trying to start the car). I didn't buy relays I just swapped some around, maybe they're both dead but they also look good. Fuel pump relay also looks good but I'm not sure. \n\nI put a new pump in because with the previous one it would start and die out/sputter and pushing gas pedal didnt help. With the new one it doesn't start at all. I think I will put the old pump in and see if it will start then die again.\n\nI may have fried the old pump because I wired it wrong the first time and it had both power and ground on the positive terminal. \n\nHow do yall think I can diagnose this/fix this? thanks",

        "selftext": "My Caravan keeps stalling, it's been going on for about 5 months, after about 15 to 25 minutes of driving it will stall. I'll wait 20 to 30 minutes and then the problem will repeat. I've cleaned the throttle body/upper intake manifold. Just got the crankshaft position sensor changed, the mechanics at the shop I went too said it was only throwing a code for the crankshaft position sensor. I'm, not too sure what to do next. Any advice or help is appreciated.\n\nI also just bought 2 camshaft position sensors, and am going to install them in a few days will update this post then. Thankyou",

Now I'm wondering how I'm supposed to install the bearing retaining clip into the knuckle after pressing the assy in, since the hub will be in the way. Any ideas? (Does the pre-1/1/05 Mazda 3 not use a retaining clip?)\n\nThe online dealer just said 'go check out our extensive video library' instead of answering the question.\n\nPerhaps I should've logged on here before purchasing, and would've seen the comments on other posts about just buying the complete knuckle assy.\n\nMy hubs are going to arrive next week.

Meaning both front tires need to have traction for movement. Otherwise the power follows the path of least resistance and one just spins. If you can get the center dug out then use something like a matt trax to slide under the tires.\n\nBut honestly. Just get help dude. Call a tow truck if it's covered by your insurance.

Put a board or brick under one tire like drivers front behind it  or the one that is the least deep and back onto the board to lift the car up and create traction on the one tire not all or two ??",

First, look around and see if you can find any rocks, wood, twigs, or something that can give traction. Once you have it, you’ll want to lift each tire and put some of the materials underneath. Once all tires are done, get in and slowly rev the car. Similar to the traction mats, you’ll want to rev faster once you feel your tires catch. You can try adding chains to each tire as well to get more traction when you try to drive",

If one wheel spins you can lightly hold the brakes to try and help it out. if after all that it still won't move you'll have to pull it out with a tractor or another car.

The problem comes that it’s still misfiring and when I put it in drive or reverse it will still hop 100ish rpm. The codes I’ve gotten are making me think it’s a timing belt issue (p0365, p0369, p0017,p0300,p0302 and p0304 and some 02 sensor codes) but I recently got into contact with the owner and we talked and he mentioned he put a new motor in which i saw a invoice in the glove box so i do believe him and it would be hard to believe that a timing chain would go out on a 10k mile motor. he did also mention that he got a ghost cam could this be why it’s hopping and misfiring.\n\nNote: mods I’ve seen done are stainless works headers, borla exhaust and air aid close air intake",

I'll try to break this down without ranting, but the sum of it is that I have a p0172 and p0175 code that won't go away.\n\nI've got a 2004 Dodge ram 1500, 5.7L hemi. it's begun throwing the codes p0172 and p0175 (fuel mixture too rich in bank 1/bank 2) and I've already changed everything that's been recommended to me to clear those codes.\n\nwhat I've done:\n\n1. replaced MAP sensor\n\n2. replaced 3/4 O2 sensors, both of bank 2 and upstream of bank 1\n\n3. replaced fuel injectors, spark plugs and ignition coils\n\n4. got a new air filter even though the old one wasn't too horrible\n\n5. replaced the fuel pump back in mid 2024\n\nit's not a huge issue when I'm really moving, like 40+ mph, but once I slow down or idle for too long it gets shaky and threatens to stall on me. most of the time when it stalls it'll be just as I'm slowing down at a red light or to park, though I have had it stall when I'm giving it gas after idling for a few minutes. it always starts back up though, as soon as I throw it in park and restart the engine.\n\nI'm not sure if it'd idle if I just let it sit there for a while, haven't tested it and don't know if that matters. all I want is to know what's wrong so I can actually fix it properly and not worry about the engine just cutting out on me at any given time. I've thrown so much money at this old girl, y'all have no idea how much stress she puts me through right now lmao",

        "selftext": "Backyard mechanic here with a question for the wise and esteemed denizens of this group.\n\nYesterday I replaced the thermostat housing on a 2003 Ford Focus Zetec engine with an aluminum version made by Solido Frio ([link](https://massivespeedsystem.com/products/aluminum-cast-thermostat-housing?variant=40022898638929)). After carefully torquing everything down, at idle I see a drop of coolant leaking from the bottom of the housing every 15 seconds or so. It looks as if the drip is coming from where the housing mates to the engine, and not between the two pieces of the housing that contain the thermostat itself.\n\nI figured the metal housing would be more durable than the original stock unit. It came with a new housing gasket. After removing the stock housing, I noticed a small amount of discolored metal (corrosion of some sort (?), but it’s an aluminum head) around the mating surface. But overall, the surface was clean and smooth except for this small area of discoloration. I didn’t think much of it when I saw it, and it felt so smooth so I went ahead with the replacement. Sorry I don’t have any pics, but I’ve left the new housing installed for now.\n\nI’d like to stop the leak, as I’m guessing that it may get worse with actual driving. I’d appreciate some ideas how to fix this. My thoughts…\n\nOption 1: remove the existing gasket and replace it with RTV. I’ve never tried to use RTV when an actual gasket is called for, but I’m willing to try it.  \n\nOption 2: Use RTV but keep the original gasket also. Not sure if RTV and gaskets go together though.\n\nOption 3: Remove the housing and then try to smooth out any imperfections on the mating surface with a 3M 7448 pad or similar, especially any disolored metal. Then reinstall with a new housing gasket.\n\nOption 4: If all else fails, add a bunch of stop leak to the coolant.\n\nDid I miss anything?",

I normally hit those areas with brake parts cleaner and a 3M medium/fine pad by hand to ensure nothing is on there.\n\nI'm not immediately familiar with this engine but it appears the \"gasket\" that is between the thermostat housing and the engine is a rubber o-ring - the thinner of the two in the provided link for the kit you used.\n\nEither the supplied o-ring is crap, the o-ring fell out of place during installation, the housing isn't tightened down enough, or the housing is not well constructed. \n\nI would remove the thermostat housing, clean the cylinder surface, ensure that the thermostat housing is square/flat, and purchase another thermostat housing o-ring before reinstalling.   \n\nSince it's an aluminum part, as well, you might need to tighten it ever so slightly more than a plastic part.  The torque spec appears to be  20Nm for the plastic housing, however, which seems more than sufficiently tight even for a stronger component. \n\nUsing RTV would be a last resort since it could just be masking a much larger problem (thermostat housing out of spec).  Dumping stop leak into the system would not resolve this issue, either, and just cause other problems.",

                        "body": "Thanks mjedmazga, very much for these pointers. \n\nYes, you're right that the thermostat housing uses a 50mm ID round gasket to seat to the aluminum head at the back of the engine. It's definitely the more delicate of the two gaskets that came with the kit. Not an O-ring exactly, cuz it has a square cross-section, with two small \\~0.5 mm high \"flaps\" on the inner and outer edges of the cylinder head side of the gasket. It looked good to me but maybe it was junk. \n\nRegarding the mating surface on the head, I cleaned it with brake cleaner and even lightly brushed it with a fine brass-bristled [brush](https://www.mcmaster.com/70305T53/) I got from my friends at McMaster-Carr. The surface was really clean, or so I thought. I didn't think fine brass bristles would damage aluminum but maybe I was wrong about that. \n\nI don't think the gasket fell out, as I was looking directly down on it as I installed it. \n\nI tightened all three of the housing's M8 bolts to 15 ftlb, or about 20.3Nm (a torque spec I got from [here](https://www.focaljet.com/threads/torque-specs-zetec-engine.510001/)), working my way up real slow from about 8 ftlb, to 12, and finally 15. Easing it to 15 ftlb only moved the bolts a few degrees more. It felt very tight to me at 15 ftlb. I'm not sure I want to go any farther. \n\nI'll get another gasket, remove the assembly, lightly scrub with the 3M pad, and the re-install. \n\nThanks again. I'll report back with the results.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\nI’m hoping someone here can help me out. I drive a 2012 Honda Crosstour and suddenly the fuel door won’t open. It’s the press-to-open type, and even though the car is unlocked, nothing happens when I push it. I’ve tried pressing, holding, gently tapping no luck.\n\nIt’s a holiday weekend, and I really don’t want to spend money on a mechanic right now unless I absolutely have to. Has anyone had this issue before? Is there a way to open it manually from inside the trunk? I heard there might be a release cable, but I’m not sure where exactly to look or how to do it safely.\n\nAny tips or photos would be amazing. Thank you so much in advance!",

        "selftext": "A few months ago, I got a company to replace my front windshield. Long story short: I thought I went through Safelite but apparently it was ShieldHub (I believe). This whole process from booking to completion was only about 5 days.\n\nWeird #1: the day after booking, they asked if I was \"open to a split job\". Apparently because of the make and model of my new hybrid car, it needed the sensors and cameras reset. I was already aware and prepared for this, but it threw me off when they made it sound like it wasn't a requirement because \"80% of the time it is not needed\". Ultimately I ended up just going with it because it would not cost me more, and in theory would save me a trip to the shop (plus I really just wanted to get this done on schedule). But I had my guards up because I have been scammed before and this seemed a little unprofessional. \n\nWeird #2: when they were on the way to my house, I called just to make sure they didn't need me so I could take a nap after a long day of work. He told me to just *leave the car unlocked so they could access the hood*. Now I don't know much about cars, but I did not think they needed to get under my hood to replace the window. So at this point my red flags are starting to fly and I didn't want to take a nap. \n\nI peeked periodically to make sure nothing funny was going on besides what I listed, but honestly that itself had me a little on edge. So the next day I took it to the shop they provided me to get the cameras and sensors realligned, even though according to these guys it should not have been required as everything seemed in order. Afterwards, the guy test drove it and showed me a screen with a bunch of diagnostic stuff that I had limited knowledge on.\n\nI know this is a pretty specific scenario that depends on the actual parties involved, but just curious if anyone has any possible insight to any foul play or malpractice that could potentially lead to issues down the road.\n\nEDIT: I've looked under the hood for anything suspicious - like those little GPS devices I've been seeing around - didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.",

        "selftext": "Buick Encore 2018 1.4 L engine. We got this car a little less than a year ago. Been having nothing but stupid oil leaks. here’s a new one after taking a trip from east side of michigan to chicago and back. didn’t come up and didn’t have engine light until today (a day after all the main city driving lol)\nChecked the engine light, says what is shown in the picture. read live data and with the help of ai tried interpreting and narrowing down a diagnosis. Here’s what it told me \n\nAll of those swings you’re seeing actually line up perfectly with the ECM’s evaporative purge cycling on and off at idle—​not you wiggling the PCV. You said you never touched anything, so:\n\t1.\tBaseline vacuum (MAP ~34–36 kPa) and MAF (~0.20–0.30 g/s) are rock-solid between purge events.\n\t2.\tEvery time the purge valve opens (~16 → 25–28 %), you see:\n\t•\tMAP jump into the 45–55 kPa range (vacuum drops)\n\t•\tMAF spike to ~0.40 g/s (extra air flow)\n\t•\tSTFT dip (ECU immediately leans out to compensate)\n\nThat pattern repeating every ~20–30 s is normal purge‐valve activity at idle. If it were a PCV leak you’d see a constant elevated MAP/MAF and a sustained positive trim, not just periodic blips.\n\n⸻\n\nNext steps to isolate PCV vs. purge\n\t•\tDisable (or clamp) the purge line for a minute of logging. If the blips disappear but MAP/MAF stay rock-steady, your PCV is fine and the purge valve was simply doing its job.\n\t•\tTo specifically test the PCV, pinching off the PCV hose at idle should cause MAP to rise and stay higher if there really is a leak.\n\nBut as this log stands, your PCV system looks healthy—those transient excursions are just the EVAP purge cycling.\n\n\nHere’s what the Group 2 run shows:\n\t1.\t0–90 s (First 1 min 30 s)\n\t•\tYou see a very steady MAP at roughly 35 kPa, MAF around 0.20–0.30 g/s, RPM ~745–755 rpm, Throttle ~18–20 %, and STFT creeping from about +0 % up toward +6 % as the engine fully warms.\n\t•\tThat smooth plateau confirms a rock-solid idle with no uncontrolled vacuum leaks.\n\t2.\t90–120 s (Wiggled PCV)\n\t•\tThe instant you disturbed the PCV line, MAP shoots up toward 45–50 kPa (vacuum lost), MAF spikes to ~0.40 g/s, RPM blips upward ~780–790 rpm (unmetered air raises idle speed), Throttle briefly jumps to ~22–23 %, and STFT climbs to about +8 % (ECU adds fuel to compensate).\n\t3.\t120–150 s (Last 30 s idle)\n\t•\tAll values snap back to the original idle levels (MAP ~35 kPa, MAF ~0.20 g/s, RPM ~750 rpm, Throttle ~18–20 %, STFT ~+4–5 %).\n\n⸻\n\nWhat this means\n\t•\tNormal idle (first/last segments): stable vacuum, airflow, idle speed, and fuel trim – no spontaneous leak.\n\t•\tPCV wiggle response: immediately triggers a vacuum leak signature (MAP↓, MAF↑, RPM↑, Throttle↑, STFT↑) – exactly what happens when the PCV path is opened under vacuum.\n\nConclusion: Your PCV valve/hose is the source of the unwanted extra air when moved. It’s confirmed as a true vacuum leak point. Replacing or seating the PCV valve and ensuring a good hose connection will stop those spikes and stabilize your idle. ￼\n\n\nHow true does this seem? Also doesn’t seem like it would have anything to do with this leaky oil i found. the oil i found wasn’t coming from the oil drain hole, which i found and double checked. it was coming from further to the front / closest to the front vents. \n\nAlso when i remove oil cap, has a rough idle and a terrible whistling sound. we take regular care of the vehicle, have had a handful of things replaced on this dang car and want to figure this out too. i didn’t see any visible areas where oil was coming from when looking from the top, but it’s too narrow for me to check under without a ramp which i plan on tomorrow. let me know if i can supply any more info that would be of use. thank you so much!",

Everysthing's fine, until after puting back my oil filter in place I found this on the ground...\n\nI wasn't sur where it came from or belonged. It seemed clean (which led me to think it came from the new filter) the external diameter is about 30mm. I ended up putting it back inside the filter because it seemed to fit perfectly here.\n\nI'd live a confirmation from you guys to be sure I didn't f.ed up 🫣\n\nThank you in advance.",

        "selftext": "I have a 2010 Nissan Rogue with 182k miles. \nIm having this issue where at random it will start and immediately stall. I figured out the way to get it to successfully start was to press the gas pedal when starting the car and sure enough it would be fine. This happens at random. \n\nMore backstory- I had some issues with the car and at the start of April of this year I had to do like $4k worth of work at the shop. Here's what they did: a new catalytic converter with a new oxygen sensor and air fuel ratio sensor, new rear brakes, replaced the front tie rod ends, replaced both front CV axle shafts, an alignment, and lastly an oil change. \n\nSo this starting-and-stalling issue started immediately after I picked up my car from this list of repairs. I took the car from them and went to the grocery store and upon leaving the grocery store is the first time this problem cropped up. Happened about a dozen times to me that night while I was running several errands. This had NEVER happened to me before that day. I brought the car back to the shop the next morning. The mechanic hooked it up to the computer and said it showed no stalling instances or something to that effect, so he assumed that the car must've been relearning something or another. The problem stopped, I figured he must've been right although he admitted it didn't really make sense.\n\nThen on 5/8 im at the start of a 10 day moving process and I start the car fine, move it so I can load it, and when I go to leave after the car is full the issue starts again. Does it many times over the next few days. At this point my gas gauge also goes nutty. It clearly isn't reading correctly, the numbers jump all around, it says I have 4 miles to the tank when there's a half tank or more- just nutty.\n\nSo I brought it back to the mechanic after my move was finally finished, a couple days ago. They say it sounds like it probably needs a fuel pump but won't know for sure until I bring it in next week and they can get a good look at it. They seem to think it's just some random coincidence that I absolutely never had this problem before that repair and it literally started right after I got it back from them after the repairs. I have a really hard time believing it's pure coincidence but they insist none of their repairs should've had anything to do with the issue im having. So im here for some knowledgeable advice.\n\nDoes this sound like a fuel pump issue? Does it sound purely coincidental to you? They said most fuel pumps run around $800 in total so before I do that im really curious to hear y'all's thoughts. Thanks in advance for your insight!",

Happens in park and while driving, and sound seems to match pacing with engine rpm. Original spark plugs. No engine performance issues or check engine lights. Oil has been maintained decently, changed every 5k-7k miles. It has only gotten low one time when I underestimated oil burn rate after an oil change. This happened around two months ago, and I’m really hoping that my negligence did not cause this sound to start. I have had the infamous Honda VTC rattle on cold start for years, but the rhythm is so odd I’m doubtful this has anything to do with that. Maybe timing chain/tensioner? Any advice welcome.

Look at it as plumbing in a house. You’re probably going to shut off your kitchen sink before you walk to the bathroom and turn on the shower. It very well could just be taking a second to shut the valve to the reverse clutch, and taking a second for the fluid pressure to reach the forward clutches and overcome the momentum of rolling backwards. As long as you don’t have really harsh sort of slamming shifts, and your transmission isn’t slipping, I wouldn’t be too terribly concerned.",

It's got nearly 230k miles, but well-maintained so not real high for this engine.  The coils and plugs are Denso OEM, aside from one set I had to have a mechanic put in for me.  It began giving me the CEL, and sometimes additionally the VTM-4 light.\n\nThe old coils had 2 fail, which is why they've all been replaced, and the plugs were at end of life at that time too.  It was also a good time to put in new injectors.\n\nWith the data from these 4 Freeze Frames I was able to pull can anyone help narrow down a possible cause for these misfires?  They've all occured over driving a 50mile span.  Thanks in advance for anyone who read this far and has any insight.",

A guy put a used lt1 motor in it and had issues with it running, and he has no idea if it could be electrical or mechanical. It had been sitting for a couple years and now it’s sitting at the top of my driveway. I was gonna start trying to diagnose problems but wanted to have all new fluids before I attempted a startup. I undid the oil drain plug and about half of a 5 gallon bucket worth of water came out and a whole lotta sludge. I kept the plug off and poured some oil into the filler cap to see what else would come out and there was big globs coming out with discoloration. I guess my first question is what should I use to flush out the motor with the motor currently not running (I really don’t want to drop the pan and take apart the top end but if I have to than o well) and 2nd what else should I do and proceed from this point, has she sat for so long it’s not trying to get the motor running?",

I thought ground wires but all of them are clean and without cuts, VATS is fine, new starter, new fuses/relays.\nI am thinking it could be the wires on the battery, I have 2 on the negative and 3 on positive. Starter has the small negative on the stud and positive on the other stud and the thicker negative on the starter bolt grounding it. \n\nClarification:\nWhen starting with key I hear the relay click, nothing to starter.\nWhen starting via jumping the terminals (with key in run position) I hear it engage for half a second and nothing else and nothing if I keep jumping it.\n\nIs there any idea of what it could be? Feel free to ask questions and whatnot.\nThank you!",

It’ll tell you how much voltage the starter is consuming, and if it’s consuming full battery voltage, you probably have a bad starter. I would also take the starter out and bench test the starter to see if you can get it to work outside of the car with a good power source. Parts these days kinda suck, and honestly it isn’t unusual to have bad parts right out of the box. I was doing a transfer case on a 24’ grand Cherokee the other day, and the aluminum casting had a ginormous crack in it straight from the factory, so it can definitely be a bad new part.",

I can feel air in the rear of the car but not in the front. I used the video bellow to try and troubleshoot the issue:  \n[https://youtu.be/aSQbAPhCdZQ](https://youtu.be/aSQbAPhCdZQ)\n\nI switched the some fuses around (Ones that seem to work fine such as the horn fuse) to try and see if its a fuse issue but it did work. I am not sure it a Freon issue as the back cabin blows cold and normal.\n\nSomething I have notices is that the AC will come back rarely and when it does i hear a groaning or grinding sound coming from below the passenger dash. After some research It may be the blower under the dash or something related.\n\nIf possible can someone give me some additional troubleshooting or a confirmation on what it might be?\n\nThank you all for any help you can provide",

        "selftext": "I have a 2017 Mini Clubman S All4 2.0T 6 speed manual with 45k miles. I bought the car in November 2024, and since I've owned it, its drifted slightly to the right. I finally got around to getting the alignment addressed recently after having some other maintenance work done that took priority (battery and coolant flush). I live in upstate NY where we salt the roads, which will be relevant, but the car is generally corrosion free and pretty clean underneath.\n\n\n\nI brought the car to \"mechanic A,\" a well respected indie shop, to have the alignment checked and adjusted. After waiting for a few hours, they came out to tell me that they snapped the rear right camber bolt due to corrosion on the bolt threads. They said they called local suppliers to find a new bolt, but none were available. They said they welded the broken bolt in place so that I could drive my car for now and sent me on my way. They seemed to have no interest in fixing it and implied I find a new camber bolt online myself. At this point, I didn't really trust them, so I left to seek help elsewhere.\n\n\n\nI took the car home and called \"mechanic B,\" whom I generally trust. I stated that I needed a new rear right camber bolt and an alignment. They suggested I bring it in to be evaluated because if a camber bolt snapped, I may need more than just the bolt. I bring it in and they tell me I need new control arms in the back, and the front inner and outer front tie rods are also seized, so I need those too. They install all the parts and perform the alignment for around $1800. I felt mildly uncomfortable with this, as I've had good luck with penetrating oil on seized bolts/threads, but I trusted them and signed off on all the work.\n\n\n\nAfter getting the car back, the alignment seems to be the same or worse, as the car seems to drift to the right slightly worse than it did before the work was performed. When letting go of the wheel, the car dips severely to the right, and keeping the car straight takes a bit of effort. Enough effort to become tiring on longer drives.\n\n\n\nI took the car to \"mechanic C\" to get a neutral opinion on the state of the alignment. They put it on their rack and showed me that the alignment is still way off, and the rear right camber bolt (in the spot which had previously been welded by mechanic A) does not adjust properly. The photo in this post is a screenshot of the car on the rack at mechanic C after the work had been done. When they spin the camber adjustment bolt, it does not make an adjustment to the alignment. They were unsure why it would not adjust and recommended I take it back to either mechanic B or the closest Mini dealer, which is 90+ minutes away.\n\n\n\nI plan to bring the car back to mechanic B this week, since they did all the work. My question is this: is it possible that the heat from the welding done by mechanic A is the cause of not being able to adjust the rear camber properly, or is it more likely that mechanic B installed the new rear control arms incorrectly? I understand it's difficult to tell without seeing it in person, I'm just looking for some direction before I speak with mechanic B this week.",

Wonder what other damage was done.. mechanic B doesn't seem like a reputable shop if they charged $1800 and still couldn't fix the initial problem (bad alignment). Seems like you got screwed. I wouldn't pay them another dollar and want it fixed correctly. That's a good chunk of money for the same problem to be even worse..",

You can test this by swapping your tires left to right and see if the pull changes direction. As for you suspension corrosion minis are pretty notorious for seized tie rods.

Heat can help but it has to be done carefully and on a very limited basis.If it takes more than one time then the tie rods need to be replaced. \n\nI would have to see first hand what is going on in the right rear. It sounds like there is either no camber bolt or maybe the shoulder that it would have pushed against to change the Camber isn't there anymore. What the first shop might have had to weld could be a captured body nut that the bolt threads into. \n\nAs far as leading to the right goes, unless the caster on the right front is less than the left front by a half a degree or more then the right hand lead isnt being caused by the alignment.",

I think it’s the ball joint. My question is, should I replace the whole control assembly (rock auto sells Moog control arms with the ball joint) or just the ball joint? I looked at the bushings and they show a little cracking on the control arm bushings.

        "selftext": "I’m experiencing an issue with my vehicle after performing a timing system overhaul, including replacing the timing chain, cam phasers, tensioners, guides, high-pressure oil pump, and variable cam timing (VCT) solenoids. The problem occurs intermittently after driving in reverse or forward and then parking. The vehicle behaves as if the timing is off, triggering diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) P0020, P0022, and P0012.\nClearing the codes temporarily resolves the issue for approximately 30 minutes, but new timing-related codes appear afterward. I suspect the issue may be related to a faulty ground connection to the powertrain control module (PCM) or an oil pressure problem causing the cam phasers to fail to lock properly. Any insights or suggestions for troubleshooting would be greatly appreciated",

Northern NV is my location if there might be shop suggestions.\n\nMy kid has a 2004 Chevy Tracker 4x4 V6 with the check engine light that was going on and off for some time. It now stays on. Codes read p0171, p0173, p0174, p0175. \n\nAfter pouring in a bottle of Rislone and him not driving it, but a half tank, the light didn't go off. He took it to a shop that doesn't smog. They did oil change (at his request) and oil filter, air filter replacement, fuel induction service, and apparently checked the o2 sensors and found them operating. \n\nMAF changed in the last 6 years. It's failed smogs before, had new plugs, MAF and such and passed. It seems that each year we have to renew registration and smog, this happens and it's not the first time we got these codes.\n\nSo, I'm looking for the most financially affordable options. Kid is a full time student, I'm on disability. $600 was just spent on the above listed services.\n\nEdited to add: It had to be driven to reset the system. So, I just drove it 60+ miles. The engine light came back on at the halfway mark and the engine was sputtering while stopped, but never stalled. It ran fine on the way to my destination, no lack of acceleration, no faltering, no loss or power or rpm. Same with the return drive other than the sputtering a bit while stopped and after gas fill up.",

        "selftext": "So I've got a 2016 Fusion. 2.0L with the ecoboost. The first issue was about 2 weeks ago. Brake pedal was hard, except only during idle. I tested the vacuum going to the brake booster, and it's only getting 5 hg idling with a warm engine. Hit 10hg right when I started it. I understand I'm supposed to have 16 to 18. The brake booster is holding vacuum just fine. The vacuum pump itself has another hose going to the top of the engine and splits from there. I haven't checked the vacuum going to the rest of the engine, but I looked them over as thoroughly as I could and It doesn't look like any of those vacuum lines are cracked or damaged. So I drove it. 2 trips, 60 miles total. By the time I got home, I had a new check engine light. P00012 cam shaft bank 1 timing retarded. I have no other issues besides the brake pedal and the lack of vacuum. No rough idle. One time I did get a drop in engine RPM just one time while hitting the brakes but hasn't happened since. My question for anyone is this, if that vacuum pump is faulty, would it throw out that code? I'm going to try testing the vacuum on the other side of the pump to see if I'm getting any leaks from that side, I'm also going to take the vacuum pump off and inspect it for function and obvious damage. I'm at a loss here. I've gone through a lot of forums and reddit and haven't found anyone who had the same exact symptoms. Any advice of things I can check, I would really appreciate.

There's another sensor on the left side of the engine opposite the booster that can apparently throw this code. Unfortunately it mounts internally so I'd have to remover the rocker arm cover. I'm still trying things. Just trying to get opinions so I fix it right the first time instead of doing damage to the engine. I'm tempted to just drive the damn thing because I have brakes after I've been accelerating, just not at idle. But with that code, I hesitate to drive it.",

It feels wrong to change it again after just 100k km.\n\nI can only hear this sound when the engine is cold. Once it warms up, there is no problem. It only manifests for a few seconds when I let go off the gas when it is in second gear and let the car “drive on its own” (without me pressing the gas pedal) as shown towards the end of the video.\n\nThanks!",

If it took an hour for your oil to drain back down to the pan, your oil pump would starve of oil within a few mins of running. \n\nProcedure for checking the oil level on most vehicles:\n\n1. Drive the car so the engine gets to operating temp.\n2. ⁠Park the car on level ground and shut the engine off. Wait 2-3 mins.\n3. ⁠Remove dipstick, wipe clean with a clean cloth or paper towel. Pay no attention to the level at this point.\n4. Reinsert dipstick fully into the tube, ensuring it’s fully seated.\n5. Remove dipstick and hold level/horizontal/parallel to the ground. Observe reading.  The oil reading should be where the oil shows around the entire dipstick, not just a thin strip. The thin strip is not a valid reading and has no impact.\n\nIf reading is above the halfway point of the two dots, take no action. If reading approaches the lower dot, add approx 0.5 quart of oil. Distance between the two dots is approx 1.0 quarts. If reading is below the lower dot, add 1.0 quarts and recheck after 2-3 mins.\n\nIf the dipstick is particularly difficult to read, you can add a bit of texture to the reading area by scuffing it with sandpaper or other light abrasion. Ensure you wipe any abrasion clean before reinserting.\n\nYour oil level looks to be right on the full mark. There’s no way for you to insert your dipstick and have a dry area with oil above it as a valid reading. The oil above the dry area is residual oil in the dipstick tube.  This is normal and can be ignored.",

Some of them specifically need to be cooled off, some specifically need to remain warm. \n\nRule of Thumb: wait at least 30s after turning the car off before checking. Pull the stick, wipe it dry, dip the stick don't soak it, pull and check.\n\nA body in motion tends to stay in motion, applies here. You need to let the oil settle to get a reading on it's level. The reason we do a quick \"dip don't soak it\" is because the oil is thick and a thin film of it will take forever to finally settle; your reading can be thrown off if you let that thin film slow drip onto the stick. \n\nFun Fact, but that property of the oil is highly engineered, it is designed to leave that film as a layer of protection between metal surfaces.",

Start by running the engine to operating temperature then shut the vehicle off. Pull the dipstick and wipe it clean, set it aside and wait 5-10mins for the oil drain to the pan and to exit the dipstick tube (helps those who has trouble reading the dipstick) check oil after that time. If results remain unchange, then you've definitely overfilled the engine. Looks to be around 2.5 quarts over if that's accurate. Engines are almost idiot proof as they can typically be run a quart high or low, though it is not recommended to but they can. In my opinion, your car will be fine as others online have filled 2x the required oil with no adverse effects short term. If i recall right their specific motor the oil hit the crank at 2.5x. How should you drain out the excess motor oil? Could repeatedly drop and empty the oil filter, small to medium filters typically hold 0.2-0.4 quarts. Could drop the drain bolt and time it, can get messy. Can drop drain bolt and hook up a vacuum to stock oil flow before installing drain bolt. Could buy a cheap $5 hand pump and go through the oil dipstick tube.",

The chain tensioners could be bad, not sure if that engine has a hydraulic one or not. If you do have a bad one that is letting the chain run real loose, that could explain the noise and poor running. If you don't feel like messing with it too much, you may be able to find another engine from a salvage yard, just make sure it's from a wreck, that way you can be reasonably sure it was running.",

It was in a prior accident & has body damage. The trans is about to go, so I'm gonna sell it soon for parts. But it lasted 5 years. I did maintenance and minimal fixes at home. The price isnt the issue. Its just learning process, buying cars from strangers and also learning how cars work so you can know when to walk away.\n\nThere is coolant in your engine if you see white smoke, its being burnt off coming out the exhaust. Coolant is not supposed to be in the engine, its very bad.\n\nThe sound in the video is not knocking. It sounds like a  rattle. Could be a timing chain.\n\nNever, ever buy a car without giving it a test drive at multiple speeds and getting a read on the owner. The moral character of the person selling the car means a lot. I live in a state with yearly inspections, so it makes it easier for me. If it doesn't have an up to date yearly inspection I don't buy. \n\n\nGood luck",

The truck was originally purchased from a retired Mexican military officer.\n\nThis has been a very rewarding project so far, but we’ve hit a wall trying to find technical documentation. We’re specifically looking for a copy (PDF or scanned) of the following manual:\n\n**TM 9-8854 / TO 36A12-1A-15**  \n*Operation – 1 Ton, 4x4 Special Power Wagon Truck M601/M615*\n\nWe’ve even looked through resources from countries where the M601 was exported (Mexico, Israel, Colombia, etc.). So far, nothing.\n\nIf anyone happens to have a scanned copy, knows where to get one, or even has a printed manual they’d be willing to share or sell, I’d be incredibly grateful. We’re especially looking for information about the transfer case, front axle declutch mechanism, and drivetrain operation—things that are specific to the M601 model and aren’t fully covered in civilian manuals.\n\nThanks in advance for any help or pointers!",

        "selftext": "I'm trying to help my 83-year-old father make a good decision about his car repairs, and I'm concerned he might be getting taken advantage of.\n\n**Background:** My father drives a 1997 Lexus LS400 with 140,000 miles. He only uses it once a week to play tennis and keeps up with regular oil changes and standard maintenance. The car is in good condition for its age.\n\n**The Problem:** A few drops of oil on the ground prompted us to take the car to a highly-rated local mechanic (5-star reviews). They did a thorough inspection with photos and provided the usual report of items needing repair, recommended work, and items in good condition.\n\n**Initial Diagnosis:**\n\n* Oil leak from valve cover gasket\n* Minor squeaking from idler pulley\n* **Approved work:** Valve cover gasket, idler pulley, plus tune-up (wires, cap, rotor, plugs) - **$2,400**\n\n**Then the calls started coming:**\n\n**Day 1:** \"The thermostat is also cracked\" - **+$220** (we approved)\n\n**Day 2:** \"The timing belt is worn and causing stalling during test drives. The belt has a 2017 date code, the engine is out of time, and this could cause severe damage since it's an interference engine. We need to replace the timing belt, water pump, and camshaft position sensor\" - **+$2,900**\n\nThey sent a photo showing a piece missing from the middle of the timing belt, and claim the belt is still intact.\n\n**My question:** Is this reasonable, or are we being taken advantage of? The escalating costs and daily phone calls with new \"discoveries\" have me concerned, especially given that my father is elderly and may be seen as an easy target.\n\nIs there a way to proove timing issue happened under their care? By looking up pervious codes showing no timing issues etc. Its never ran rough or stopped before. \n\nWhat questions would you ask the mechanic shop?\n\n\n\nImage Links:  \n  \nPhoto of timing belt:  \n[https://i.postimg.cc/XYMpQwsQ/SCR-20250524-mxec.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XYMpQwsQ/SCR-20250524-mxec.png)\n\nTechnican notes of timing issues:   \n[https://i.postimg.cc/yY7Vdvrq/image-15.png](https://i.postimg.cc/yY7Vdvrq/image-15.png)\n\nFull Report:   \n[https://i.postimg.cc/RFfM38Bm/screencapture-app-autoserve1-report-Rm-Fuc-WNyy-Kmt-A6-HJK-2025-05-24-14-32-47-edit.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/RFfM38Bm/screencapture-app-autoserve1-report-Rm-Fuc-WNyy-Kmt-A6-HJK-2025-05-24-14-32-47-edit.jpg)\n\n\n\nHe drove it in with a few drops of oil on the ground. Now its turned into a large bill and vehicle isnt running at all.   \n\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

Ratings can be and are manipulated/bought.  Ratings mean nothing when they can be appealed/removed.  Find a good shop by asking people you know.  If everyone says \"This place\" go to that place.

Sadly, you can't prove they intentionally disabled the engine or changed the timing. \n\nNot that I'm a suspicious guy, but I'd go over unannounced and ask to try it out. They may well have tweaked things(not necessarily timing) to disable the engine, like pulling a coil wire, fuel pump fuse, any number of things, sadly.  Even if it doesn't start, I'd stay with the car until a tow truck arrives to take it somewhere else. \n\nIf it really >did< jump timing, and they themselves didn't do it(I understand sending a pencil in between the belt and pulley will cause a one-tooth jump!), they can't be sure that the head or valves aren't already trash until you pay them another $2900 or more.",

It means the code/ CEL is on hold depending on the outcome of the second test.\n\nTime for some proper diagnostics..but I sense a very expensive repair in your future (new cats/ O² sensors)..",

Keep it as straight as possible. once a tap hole is started, you can go up in size gradually. Get to a size where you can use either reverse bits or an extractor and carefully feel how its biting. either it will move or it wont but the amount of tension is critical so you dont break the bit or extractor. Its a delicate job. If after reading this you have any question in your ability to do this successfully STOP and get a professional.",

I trust the  mechanic shop i go to and i dont want to over tighten the bolts myself and end up warping the pan, should i try to snug the bolts myself anyway? Or go to a different mechanic shop and maybe they can see something different that will solve this problem? ",

He's been dealing with what I believe is a wiring issue, but he doesn't think so. It has 240,000 miles on it.(he doesn't have money for another vehicle unfortunately)\n\nThese events happened in this order \n\n- Car completely died and had a fuel pump computer no communication code. Took it to a local shop, they replaced the computer and it seemed to work fine \n\n- Car died a month later, buddy found a wiring issue. Fixed it, returned the new computer and put the old one back in. Car is still running \n\n- Shortly after this, maybe a week or two, there's a code that says \"fuel pump control module open circuit\". He replaced fuel pump, car starts once (hard start) and won't start again but will crank. \n\n- Current: After fuel pump and starting just once, now there's a \"fuel rail pressure sensor performance\" code. \n\nSome other informationl: \n\n- Truck is getting barely any fuel pressure \n- Voltages are all fine on all the computer modules \n- Fuel pump has sound when commanded off & on \n- Fuel line that connects fuel pump to fuel rail does not click onto the fuel pump fully. You can pull it off by hand if you tug hard enough, no tool needed. \n\nShould we replace the fuel rail pressure sensor, or could it be the fuel line end? or just more wiring problems? ",

On the flow bench at work I can get higher port velocity, if I can’t find those I will either use the stick heads ported or 302 castings that are closed chamber) for pistons if I get the close chamber heads wil be KB167 flat tops with ten thousandth decked from the block or so for 0 deck, or get KB 399’s for very high compression, they will fit with no other heads besides the 920’s which could take the same exact domed design in the commando 273. This would put me at a static 11.5 to 1 or more I’ve never used that piston with 920s on a 318 before only on commandos I’ve rebuilt. so if I deck the block as much as possible without hitting the head with the piston. I’m using a forged crank I had lying around out of a 340 that is beautiful, but I have one more idea.\n\nSTROKER. Now I HAVE to use this 318 block. It was the engine left inside my fiancés fathers van before he passed and her mother has one wish, it be put into a car he would’ve liked, and she be allowed to use it. So I took it out of his old \n b200 and got it unseized, will be taking it to work and machining the block and over boring it .020 so I can fit most aftermarket pistons.  Car is a dodge aspen RT with original factory p*** and stripes, factory four speed shell with a title that’s absolutely mint from twenty feet away.\n\nHAS ANYONE EVER STROKED THEIR 318?? do not tell me I can get a 360 cheap. 400 horsepower is esy to make on a 318 with a cam, headers, intake and carb. Stock heads; you can get 500 NA out of them and they’ll spin 7,000 rpm without much trouble, it’s totally capable and idk why no one touches them\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR EXPERIENCES STROKING IT??what pistons did you use? Or what kit did you use? What KYB pistons can be used with a 318 stroker if any? (They’re my go to brand for street engines without boost) ",

Is it because I used a budget friendly oil brand? \n\nPeople keep telling me these engines “just tend to tick” but I’d prefer it to go away. Any clue why it’s doing this and how I could fix it? ",

I haven’t experienced any loss of power, no stalls, no problems turning car on, no dimness in headlights when things are plugged in like chargers. I turned it off and turned it back on after 10 minutes with no problem and then again after it being off for 1 hour it still turned on with no problem. So if it’s turning on it can’t be the alternator but if it’s the battery shouldn’t there be signs of a low battery? Thanks for any help",

This happened today and also a month ago. This time there was a present gasoline smell. Whenever I do start my car in general though my vehicle trembles aggressively but turns on/starts fine. While driving I don’t feel any gear shifts nor does it really struggle to accelerate. My car does shake a lot at 50-60 mph but I believe that’s due to a long needed rotation but I couldn’t get them rotated because it was found that my rear wheels are slightly larger than the front ones. Any ideas on what this could be and what I should prepare for? Clear dashboard. ",

        "selftext": "Hi good ol mechanics of reddit! So a junkyard in my area is having a 50% holiday sale and I wanted to know should i pull the trigger and as a project I wanted to swap my nag1 trans and put in a 8speed\n\nI got a 2013 Dodge charger i got for dirt cheap. Plus some money to waste and time go spend. I like the Nag1 but it’s a little rough every once in a while yet doesn’t miss any gears and hauls ass. But i just like how the v8 sounds with a 8spd over the mush sounds from the 5spd shifting. \nThing is my junkyard just put in a freshly wrecked charger that’s a 2017. I wanted to rip out it’s trans but ik i need more than that. What all do i need from the car in order to be ready to then begin the swap\nIk i need : trans, shifter, some sort of wiring harness, flex plate, mount, and drive shaft",

If you did do a standalone controller for the transmission, you still have to deal with the PCM thinking the transmission isn’t communicating. Honestly it sounds like you should just swap the transmission and run standalone controllers for the engine and transmission separately. It’s definitely going to be pricey, but it’s doable. I wouldn’t expect to walk away for less than 5 grand at a minimum, and I’d expect probably closer to 7-8 grand. Just tuning that thing by itself with factory controllers is going to be a good chunk of change without all the parts. If I were you, I’d just put some power adders on the engine, tune that, and get your transmission beefed up with a different stall. Those 8 speeds are pretty good drivers though!",

I was able to get a replacement but now I can't get it to seat flush. I tried bending the metal straight where the bracket goes but no dice. The bracket uses one single screw a little back from the centre and it seems to be raising the front more as soon as i tighten it down. I cant get it to sit flush no mater what I do!!\n\nTook some pictures to show what I'm dealing with.\n\nHas anyone dealt with this before? Any and all advice is much appreciated\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szlc5hocnt2f1.jpg?width=1144&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5167525cb99160f3f7b2500890878f16aa9d60f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/92k29suent2f1.jpg?width=1144&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e496f648b358fc9d606740b28f289e6b8262460\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b0u5v8pfnt2f1.jpg?width=1144&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=418f98e2591dbb0bb83b6437bd85d86e56a3a6c2\n\n",

Take that little rubber piece out of the front and rotate the rotor (usually where the hole is at the bottom) until you find an adjuster wheel perpendicular to the hole. Its shaped like a gear with notches. Stick a screwdriver in there and spin the adjuster wheel to loosen the drum brake shoes inside (i think you spin it downwards - but you'll know pretty quickly if you're tightening it). The shoes inside that outer drum part often wear a groove into the inside of the rotor and provide resistance when removing the rotor. Adjusting the shoes back inward typically allows for the rotor to then come off. When you put the new rotor back on, (if you plan to use your parking brake) adjust the drum shoe back outward into the rotor until it's tight and then back it off just a bit until the rotor can spin with ease again. If you leave that chunk missing it could eat up your brake pad and subsequently, your caliper. Or it could be just fine. But probably the former.",

Spray some rust penetrant first on the hub where the rotor meets it. The dust seal on the front shpuld be able to give ypu a peek at the park brake adjuster. If you need to, loosen the park brake manually. And lastly, that rotor may have a lip on the drum side that cannot slip over the friction material of the park brake shoe, or, hardware that may be misadjusted or loose hardware that is spreading the brake shoe. An easy way to get an idea is if you can rotate the rotor clockwise or counter-clockwise. If it moves in this way the hardware is likely ok. \n\nAt the end of the day the rotor will require a replacement. And I do recommend replacing both sides now.",

Then when you can't turn the adjuster anymore just hit the rotor between the studs with a hammer and it should pop off the hub a little. Use some compressed air to blow all the dust off the shoes when the rotor is off. Fit the new rotor and then turn it until you see the adjuster again, turn it the opposite way you turned it before when letting it off until you can no longer turn the rotor or adjuster, then let the adjuster off 2-3 turns and test your handbrake with a pry bar on 2 studs to see if it moves, if it doesn't move when the handbrake is applied that's good, release the handbrake and check if the rotor is turning again. Apply the new pads and grease em up and then fit the caliper back on and then take it for a drive to bed the new pads into the new rotor.",

But, you should be able to get a screwdriver, or other ratchet based tool into the rotor’s set/release pin there at 7oClock position.  I believe that will allow you to “twist inward to “pull” the rotor off or unstick it at least”.  Did you try beating the rotor with a small sledge?

I brought it up to mechanics and they brushed it off as no big deal. \n\nWell, I believe it's a big deal now or very soon.\n\nWhat used to be a noise so quiet you had to strain to hear it, has become increasingly louder over the course of a few days. Really scratching my head on this as it's not the hub bearings, it's not the brakes, it's not the suspension. All have been replaced in the last few days or weeks.\n\nSeems inherently tied to the wheels or at least forward motion. The sound is not present in reverse, but is present when in gear, even at the slowest speeds. The sound disappears after 20mph or so, but this could be road noise drowning it out.\n\nI cannot hear the noise outside of the cabin.\n\n[Here is a recording of the noise in question](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10uZcnNYYTTl5Fzs2ssZFlbVnFdh3FN-F/view?usp=drivesdk)\n\nAny help is sincerely appreciated.",

Based on what I see on your engine it’s possible that someone had a catch can installed to collect oil and send the rest of the vapor back to the intake, but you’re missing some plumbing here. Excessive crankcase pressure and vapor would indicate worn piston rings or a blown head gasket but I don’t see excessive vapor here just nothing to collect it.",

Since then the over heating issue has gone away but the no heat (specifically on the driver side heat on the passenger side works great) has remained. I have had it into twice under warranty and they have swapped the heater core. The issue goes away for a few months and then returns. Does anyone have any thoughts on what may be occurring, is it possible this is a different issue they have just misdiagnosed I feel bad making them do all this warranty work but this is getting quite frustrating.

And probably a telescopicing magnet to grab the plugs out. \nWhen you take the coils out do not just throw them back in a random order, it has to be the SAME order you took it out. \n\nCoolant service just needs you to drain the coolant a couple times and then run with a no spill funnel out the radiator to remove air pockets for half an hour. Dont try this if you just stopped driving the coolant will erupt all over ur face. Youll need a good amount of coolant as well as a coolant catch and disposal for the coolant.",

A month or so ago it stopped reliably shifting into reverse, needing anywhere from two to ten tries to get into gear. Today a new symptom popped up; the car just won't shift into third anymore.\n\nThis last symptom only happens after the car has warmed up. I left it off for about half an hour and when I turned it back on it was shifting okay, but still slipping from second to third. Then, as I was rolling down the road in fourth gear, the car slammed back to second and wouldn't shift any higher.\n\nI'm beyond fed up with this lemon, but I need it. I'm not exactly in a good financial place right now, and I can't get another vehicle. What could it be, and how can it be fixed?\n\nEDIT: I read somewhere that I could reset the transmission by turning the car on but not the ignition, and holding the gas pedal down for 30 seconds. I tried that and took it for a drive and the issue persisted. Then on the way home, the car died in the middle of the street. I pulled over and started it again and it came on long enough for me to get back home. So we can add electrical issues to the transmission woes.",

                "body": "You can do everything but the alignment. In fact, I did all those besides the alignment in the last month, plus a few more things, one of which was a rack and pinion replacement. If it helps you feel more confident I can tell you that I had never worked on a vehicle besides for doing oil changes and rotations. This was in my opinion a huge undertaking, and it was on a 19 year old cargo van that lived up north, so the rust build up was substantial. I also got a quote similar to yours but higher because of the rust and the car being bigger (I guess). I did it all my self and I can give you a couple of tips I wish I had before taking on the project:\n\n1. Watch YouTube videos before doing any of them. Specifically, look for people who point the \"wrong way to do this or that\". Those helped me know what not to do as well as the correct things to do. You do not want to take on this project to save money and then end up making a bigger mess. I also would watch a couple because some people had specific tricks. Also, if you can't get through something specific, like the rotor or hub being stuck and not coming out after hammering it for half an hour, look up on YouTube for tricks. How I wished I had done that before hammering at the old rotor for like an hour.\n\n2. Buy/rent/borrow some power tools, and quality ones too. I could've done it without power tools, in fact, I did like half the list without them. Then my wife convinced me to buy some, not much, just a Milwaukee 3/8 Stubby Impact (the one with 550lbs of nut loosening torque), a rachet (any you want, I got the Milwaukee Insider), and I personally got as well the biggest Milwaukee Impact Wrench you can buy at Home Depot, but you can probably do without it. That thing took care of everything and anything that was stuck. Once I got the power tools, I was just laughing while getting nuts and bolts in and out. I also got a nice 1/2 torque wrench, I think it was a DeWalt for $100. Total of tools was $1,300 or so after extra accesories and adapters, but now I have learned to love working on cars and I can use those tools from now on. In fact I'm soon finishing a second car.\n\n3. Buy tools that will help get stuff unstuck, like a propane torch, a sledge hammer, and a bunch of PB Blaster (as well as parts cleaner for the install). If you get a lot of stuck parts because of rust build up, make sure to clean it before installation and then paint it before reinstalling too so it doesn't happen as bad next time. I used anti-sieze where possible.\n\n4. Have patience. Don't try to tackle all in one day, or all in a couple of hours. Step back when you get frustrated. I personally decided to take care of things in pairs or so, and then divided the work on a couple of days. The rack and pinion took the longest but that's mainly because I was trying not to brake the old lines and the angles were wicked. \n\nYou can do this! I saved tons of money by doing it myself and I feel confident I can do it again. Funny thing, when I finished this project we realized my wife's car also needed a rear wheel hub replacement. I did that in about 30min with all the experience I got from working on an older and rustier car. I loved the experience and I now know my truck much better. Soon I'll do an upper arm replacement and then probably the suspension tower as well on a different car. There's also a belt tensioner I gotta take care of and then I will try to find and fix an AC leak on the truck. I'm so excited!\n\nQUICK NOTE: get the lifetime alignment from Firestone. Super worth it. I did an alignment when I went to get the state inspection but then I was told I needed the rack and pinion fixed because it was leaking. I replaced it and came back one week later to re-do the alignment. It already paid for itself by doing it twice in a month.",

If you can get a replacement set that includes springs and is assembled, then it’s a straight swap, otherwise you’ll need a spring compressor \n\nIf you live anywhere that salts the roads, you’re gonna need a torch, a big ass hammer, some prayers and copious amounts of penetrating fluid.",

The control arms fit right back where they were as long as the tie-rod has not been altered.\n\nAn inoperative license plate light is almost surely nothing more than a bulb.

        "selftext": "2003 Honda Element before photo of the lower ball joints- do these look like they are in bad shape? \nthe mechanic replaced the two lower ball joints but I just found out they didn’t do an alignment after \n\nHave had the worst experience with an auto repair shop this past week (took in my car for a door locking issue and of course they made 3 other things in the car seem super dire - actually telling me the car is not drivable because of the ball joint condition.) I said yes to two of the repairs (ball joints, brake pads, and the door fix) and a week later (5 days later than they had said the car would be ready- delayed because they ordered the wrong parts) I just demanded them to release the car to me and the door is still not fixed. They said they replaced the lower ball joints but didn’t do an alignment after (which is bad right?) \nAnd I paid $1,120 just for the ball joints. \n\nI feel like I got scammed but was curious if anyone has any feedback. Thanks!\n",

It’s been a nightmare. \n\nAlso, last time I did this I cut those tabs off. In the second picture, If you look at how bad this rotor is (after a year I think) it just doesn’t make sense. \n\nMy questions: what in the world is this tab for? Can I cut it off again? Could cutting it off be the reason my rotors are so bad? Why are the rotors so bad? (Pads had plenty of life left) ",

                "body": "Oriented to the picture: the top \"leg\" fits on the outside of the abutment hardware, and acts like a spring clip to help keep the pad from dragging and extend life. The other portion is a wear sensor, designed to squeal when the brakes reach a worn state. The rotor looks terrible imo. Did you replace them last time or slap pads on it? I usually see this on cars that sit a lot (located in CT).\n\nIf the clips are preventing the pad installation, verify the pads are correct, the hardware (abutment clips) are installed properly, and the caliper mounting points have been cleaned prior to hardware installation. That being said, these are probably the biggest PITA pad style for subies (source: I hate doing these kind, always gotta fuck with the hardware to get the pads in).",

And no, I did pads and rotors last time. However, we cut the tabs off and I think that may have caused things to overheat and fuck the rotor up that bad. \n\nDid the rears as well and used some pliers to spin the ABS thing in, then used a c clamp the rest of the way. What’s your opinion on that? Seemed to work fine but I see a lot of different ways people say to do that due to the ABS. \n\nAlso bled them, which was very easy. My favorite part. Overall took 8 hours with a few breaks and fixing some fuck ups lol. Saved money though. I’ll take your recommendation for brakes for next time I do it",

They told me I needed my spark plugs replaced, filters replaced, and some other work than ended up totaling over 1000 dollars. A week after that, my car wouldn’t turn over and I ended up having to have AAA come out. They said my battery connection was loose, he tightened it and all was well. I ran into the same issue yesterday, AAA came out again. He said again the battery connection was loose and he wasn’t able to tighten it. I am a car novice, but he showed me that one of the cables that connects the battery (what the first AAA guy had tightened and fixed) was easily removable which shouldn’t be the case. I had AAA tow it to my mechanic who did the work on my car before. He said my starter was bad and needed replacing and quoted me another 700 dollars. I feel a little strange that neither AAA guy said anything about my starter, that the first guy was easily able to fix it by tightening the battery connection, and that this guy just looked at my car and found 1100 dollars worth of work to do but didn’t see anything wrong with the battery or starter. I’ve had this car since 10/2023, I got it used, it’s a 2021 Hyundai. I’ll admit I’m pretty ignorant when it comes to car things, is it reasonable for me to feel suspicious and frustrated? Or am I just having bad luck?",

As soon as I turn the A/C on and let it come up to idle, the engine occasionally dips in RPM then spikes back up and the whole car shakes a bit. I can actually feel the air get noticeably colder each time the RPM jumps, and then it gradually warms up again as the idle falls—until the engine revs up again and the cycle repeats. When the compressor is off, the idle is rock-steady and there’s zero shake.\n\nI’ve already tried:\n\n* A quick throttle body spray-clean (no relearn procedure yet)\n* Checking for obvious vacuum leaks\n* Inspecting engine mounts (they look okay but not factory-new)\n\nAny ideas on what could be causing this A/C-on idle instability? Is it more likely an idle air control issue, throttle body relearn, low refrigerant, failing compressor clutch, or something else? Appreciate any diagnostic tips or experiences!",

        "selftext": "So my truck has been having a bad misfire and I have no idea what’s causing it if you have any ideas any help is appreciated. \nReplaced parts- \nTiming chain \nIntake manifold \nValve cover gaskets \nInjectors \nCoils \nSpark plugs \nAir filter \nMost vacuum lines \nOil pump \nWater pump\nMass airflow sensor\n\nI’m pretty sure the fuel regulator is alright when I pull the vacuum line off it doesn’t spray gas out of it but I’m at a loss on what it is. After changing the injectors it ran great for 2-3 days and started misfiring again on my way home from work. I’ve put injector cleaner in the tank(if that even works) but other then that I’m not sure any help would be great thank you for reading.",

        "selftext": "So I’ve had a 2008 Mustang GT for about 2 years, I don’t enjoy using AC and it has never blown cold which doesn’t bother me. My girlfriend, though, is sick of it.\n\nIt blows cold every once in a while, like for maybe 10 minutes every 20 minutes or so, then goes back to just blowing outside-temperature air. I’ve hooked up a canned air gauge, and the needle goes right to red. I’ve removed freon, added it, and it always just stays in the red, whether the compressor clutch is engaged or not.\n\nAnyone know where to look at? I am quite mechanically savvy but car AC is new to me. This is my first time ever addressing the issue with any car, and I’ve never taken a car to a shop, only fixed my own issues. Just need to know if this is something I can fix on my own or would it be smarter to take it in?\n\nMany thanks to anyone who can help 😁",

        "selftext": "I have a 2019 Ford Ranger that I bought new. I live in the northeast US and my truck has a little over 62,000 miles. It's my daily, and I keep it well washed and get the salt off as soon as I can. I climb underneath every now and then and do most of my own oil changes. So far I haven't seen anything concerning, and I've used some touch-up spray on some sharp edges of steel that started to turn.\n\nBut I'm considering a more serious undercoating. My father was sort of an old greaser who loved talking cars and made sure to share all of his strong opinions about them. He was dead-set against them, and thought it ruined my mother's old 76 Pinto. She always disagreed. I kind of understand, like spray-on bed-liners, it's such a permanent step and it can be a mess as time goes by, and there's concern that it can do more harm than good. But for an undercoating, I'm not worried about it looking perfect, I just want it to preserve and protect my daily driver for as long as possible.",

Engine oil pan gasket. Feeling like getting dirty?Somethin you can absolutely do by yourself. Just take your time and do the research.\n3. Transmission fluid, again basically just an oil change but with the transmission. You could save a good chunk of change doing this yourself. Did it on my accord quite easily.\n4. Power steering fluid, I’d probably leave it to a pro. \n5. Cabin air filter. Literally the easiest job ever. Takes 2 minutes tops. Check your owners manual on how to change it.\n6. Don’t do suspension work yourself, let a pro handle it. It’s not fun to do in your back yard.\n7. Spark plugs. Front ones are dumb easy. Pull the coils off, get a spark plug wrench and take em out. Put the new ones in, snug em down and put the coils back on. Rear bank will probably be more of a pain in the ass, might have to move the windshield cowl which is a pain.\nWatch a video on it and see how comfortable you feel doing it.\n8. PCV valve. SUPER easy. Here’s a video on it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4KVz3kXsdUc?si=eqsPfqcfsRmTT8mo\n\n9. Timing belt. Let him do it. Definitely a job you do not want to fuck up.\n\n10. Fuel injection service? Probably snake oil.\n\n11. Coolant flush. A messy job but not terribly difficult. Can DIY or just have him do it.\n\n12. Brake fluid flush. Definitely have him do it, huge pain in the ass to do yourself.\n\n13. O2 sensors are a pain, I’d let him do it.\n\nTL;DR:\nYou can do the majority of this stuff at home with cheap basic tools and save a buttload of cash. Spark plugs, oil changes, and other small jobs are a great way to save cash and learn about your car.",

It squeaks all the time during driving, doesn't matter wether I'm braking, accelerating or coasting, even when standing still and the weight transfers (people getting in and out). At first I thought it was the suspension but I managed to narrow it down to the handbrake when I took apart the drum.\n\nIn the video you can see the handbrake being pulled up and down, causing the spring that covers the cable to rub against the metal casing of the drum brakes. I do have to mention the handbrake itself works fine, as in it's not too tight or too loose and holds the car steady on steep inclines.\n\nMy question now would be, how do I go about fixing this? Could this be due to wear? I don't imagine it's designed to have the cable run this tightly. I have more pictures but I can only post one at a time.",

Yesterday couldn’t accelerate or get up a hill. Limped it to mechanic who said CVT fluid is low but there are no leaks. Dealer replaced CVT fluid at 100k. Is it the alternator or CVT?

It says I’m due for one in August, or when it gets to 215300, which it has. I’m at 216500 right now, and I’m wondering about how long can I wait to get this next oil change? I just spent $60 and really would like to wait another month IF I can. \n\n\nThanks for the input! ",

        "selftext": "I have a 1993 Subaru SVX with a brake issue.\n\nThe other day driving home the front right brake did not release and was dragging a lot.  I stopped in a parking lot, and with some tools took the caliper off and swung it up on the pivot and tried to push the pads back in with a c-clamp.  It's a two piston caliper and pushing on one just make the other come out farther.  This was true for both pistons, so it seems that the caliper is fine.  I removed the shims from the brake pads so that the caliper would fit back together and wheel could spin again and crept home, mostly using the parking brake to slow/stop.  \n\nAt home I did some more testing.  Push the brakes hard, and the wheel sticks again.  Cracked the bleeder and then it backed off enough to spin again.  I tightened the bleeder, and pumped the brakes a bunch again, and the wheel locked.  I then cracked open the connection between the flexi hose and the metal line, and again it released ok.  \n\nI did install the replacement caliper, since I had bought it anyway figuring the rubber seals in the old one got a good toasting.  Same issue after installing the reman caliper.\n\nSo..from what I've concluded is that the caliper is fine, and I believe that the flex line is probably fine and not collapsed since the pistons move ok and the brake pressure was released at the hose/metal line connection, so the hose doesn't seem to be blocking the flow to release the caliper.  \n\nSo now I'm not sure but I'm guessing that the problem is farther back toward the master cylinder, but where and what to check next?\n\nA few other notes - I do change the fluid every 1-2 years and it is pretty clean.  The flex lines are Goodridge brand with overbraiding, installed about 10 years ago.  The car does have an ABS system.  The brakes worked very well, just as they have been for many years, up until the other day.  I've owned the car for about 25 years and the braking hardware is all original, except the flex lines, pads, rotors.  The Master cylinder is original.\n\nMy next thought is to just replace the master cylinder and hope it's the culprit.  A new MC is about $85 so not a big problem, but maybe I'm missing something?  Any help would be appreciated before I throw some more parts at it.  Thanks.",

I’m really hoping this is a battery issue and not a stater or fueling issue. It did just start to happen kind of suddenly.

I has had a small coolant leak for around the last 3 thousand or so and recently, after killing the engine, I noticed a fan has stayed running for a few seconds. What could it be? I've not noticed any weird color oil so I don't think it's a head gasket but I don't really know ",

As I mentioned earlier, we haven’t been able to get it to overheat during testing. However, the vehicle’s computer has stored diagnostic trouble codes indicating a faulty thermostat, a malfunctioning temperature sensor, and a failed coolant level [sensor.In](http://sensor.in/) addition, we found that the pipe housing these sensors is leaking antifreeze. Based on our findings, I’ve put together an estimate that includes replacing the coolant pipe along with the sensors, and installing a new thermostat housing with the integrated thermostat. Please note that replacing the thermostat on this model is labor-intensive and requires approximately five hours of labor.Also included in the estimate is a battery replacement, as the current one is leaking and tested marginal during our evaluation.The total cost for parts, labor, and tax would normally be $2,698.32. However, I can offer you a package deal at $2,450 out the door.Take some time to review the estimate and let me know if you have any questions or how you'd like to proceed.\"",

It keeps saying that I need to SHIFT TO P(se photo) even though the car is in P. It's also throwing a parking brake malfunction - I can activate and deactivate the parking brake and it works perfectly, so I don't understand why it's giving a fault code, that cannot be cleared.\nI have replaced batteri, and replaced/renovated rotors and brake calipers on all four wheels.\n\nWhen connected to a computer the car has a lot of fault codes, that cannot be cleared. I didn't get a print of the codes, but wil tomorrow (sorry, forgot)\n\nWith ignition on and brake pedal down, I cannot get the car out of P. I had to remove the ashtray and a little plastic cover, so I could push down a little safety pin, in order to shift from P to N. stil no starting.\nAll fuses is okay, and I don't think it's critters that have been chewing ind the wiring, cause I cant se any signs, but I'll guess I need to get the car on a lift to check properly.\n\nSo basically the car has been standing for one year. It's was running perfectly, with no fault codes when it was put aside, and now It has a lot of fault codes, that cannot be cleared.\n\nAny advice is highly appreciated, and thanks in advance 💪😎",

I also started noticing it having a hard time on hills and in the cold. It would sputter when idling then accelerating. One time it actually turned off. I checked the codes and got p000a so I changed my oil & filter, cleaned the VVT solenoids, and reset the codes. \n\nCouple weeks later it happened again and I got P000b too so I replaced all 4 VVT solonoids and the top 2 camshaft position sensors. I went to a shop initially and they confirmed I was on the right track & they replaced one of the VVT solenoids and then I did the last 3 because I already knew how to take them out from cleaning them. \n\nCleared the codes and now they lights are back again- p000a and p000c. I bought two more camshaft position sensors to replace the two bottom ones but haven't done it yet. Am I totally off track?? ",

        "selftext": "Good day!\n\nI do the wrenching on my own cars a lot, but not much with suspension. \n\nTook my 97 s10 4x4 4.3 V6 to the shop to get an alignment done, and they told me they couldn’t do the alignment due to failing pitman and idler arms. The quote they gave me seems excessive, especially with parts I’m seeing online. Obviously, I see that it isn’t a super simple job, but I also don’t want to pay almost $1000 for what seems like it should be closer to half that. Is that a fair price? I have the tools required, and could figure it out on my own with maybe $200 worth of parts, I just want a reality check. \n\nThanks!",

My first thought was I’m in limp mode but also that my O2 sensor might be messed up before I got the car the previous owner took off 1 of the 2 catalytic converters and the one he took off just so happens to have had an O2 sensor right before and after the converter so not one of the O2 sensors isn’t doing anything is that what’s causing it or is it something else? The video shows right after I started it I sent the video to a buddy to get his opinion and he was stumped also. ",

Let the car sit overnight and now I get this. \n\nThought it was the starter last night, but this seems like a battery issue? Battery is fully charged and connections are tight, though.

There's no way my turbo got hot enough to melt itself like this? Did it get hot and work some solder loose and seize itself? The turbo is only 2 months old...\n\nWhat can I do to fix this?

Pretty bad if I saw so myself, anyhow he’s got pretty much no budget for an entire exhaust system and I don’t feel like replacing it all for him so I want to do the simplest and cheapest method. My current option seems to be cutting the broken o2 pipe and sliding a walker 41821 (I attached a picture of one) connector pipe with an o2 bung preinstalled and using exhaust clamps to hold it together and I believe the oem pipe is 2.5in OD and this connector is 2.5 in ID so I think it might work.

According to ChatGPT in some cases the vapor line from the tank goes straight to the n80 valve leaving the bottom hose tule useless and blocked of but it wasnt blocked off (at least not in a way visible from the outside of the canister) so i am not sure, does someone have information about this? There is a thin hose (to thin to fit on the tule from the canister) behind the rear wheel cover but i am pretty sure thats to allow air in the fuel tank to prevent a vacuum. ",

The eml light doesn't come on but I can tell when it'll come up by the low power and stalling. So far I've changed both camshaft sensors, spark plugs, put new oil and filter in and a new vvt solenoid. Ive also had the timing chain done at the start of the month which helped the car performance massively. But the code is still coming back. I'm taking the car back to the mechanic on Monday after speaking to him. But I was just wondering what else could cause this? Feel like I've done everything that I could do fix it now and running out of patience with it. \n\nThanks 👍 ",

My concern is what happens if I can’t get straight onto a road straight from the garage. Reading the steps to take it sounds like you must start the bedding in process immediately after getting in the car. Is it really that strict or can I drive somewhere further away to do it, but even then I will have to use the brakes between the garage and that location.",

        "selftext": "Okay, I would post this in r/cars but I'm relatively new to reddit and don't have enough karma yet but hopefully you guys can help or point me where to go! Basically, I like to travel and I don't mind driving like 1000 miles for a weekend trip. The issue is if I want to continue these trips I should probably know some basic maintenance stuff to save on costs and in case of emergency. I'm not a dummy and I know a lot of specific issues can be found on YouTube but I'd like to buy a beater truck off MarketPlace (like an F150 from the 90s or something cheap) as a project car but I wouldn't even know where to begin on something like that. Like I know when I'm actually looking at the trucks I should avoid a lot of iron oxide on the frame but beyond that are there any red flags I should keep an eye out for? I also don't know what kind of tools I would need. I have a decent wrench set, a jack, and a code reader and I know some parts can be rented from like Advanced Autoparts but is there anything else I should have on hand? Once I actually have the car I assume to start with obvious issues on the exterior (wheels, windshield, etc) but once it comes to under the hood I'm pretty lost. If anyone has any suggestions for good YouTube series on this it would be appreciated. ",

Cruise the forums and youtube about issues you are interested in solving.\n\nBuy or download the factory service manual. Make small repairs you feel confident in.  Learn to identify all the parts of your vehicle. What engine does it have? What suspension? What are all the drivetrain issues you might have?\n\nFreshen up all the basic stuff. Engine fluids, differential, brakes, shocks/coils. Tires and any small broken systems like wipers, washer fluid motor, lights etc.\n\nJust get an old car you like and start on the basic stuff. It takes a while. But if you do little projects you will learn about the vehicle. Buy tools as you need them. Have fun. Take it one thing at a time. There will be issues you can't solve. Its fine to take it to a shop. Just make sure if its an older vehicle its a place that specializes in that.\n\nGood Luck!",

But they require that you do know how to diagnose issues the old fashioned way. Mine has an obd1 port, and the only feedback you get is a sequence of flashes that can indicate a handful of vauge issues. It hardly has any sensors and is almost entirely analog. Which is nice, but that means it cant tell you what's wrong with it. So if it doesn't want to start, or stalls, or runs weird...you need to figure out whats wrong on your own. Which again, is fine if you know how to work on vehicles and diagnose issues. But if not, you're going to get very frustrated very quickly.\n\nWhat Id suggest for you is something in the 2000-2012 range of years. No newer than that! Newer vehicles than that got way less DIY friendly in their design. Also after 15 years, almost every possible issue has been experienced and documented by someone online somewhere. So there's a wealth of information available.\n\nPick a vehicle that is extremely common, the more common the better. You want to be able to walk into any autoparts shop anywhere and find parts...that way if you break down on one of your trips you arent shit out of luck. But dont buy your parts at autoparts stores if you can avoid it. Rockauto.com and salvage yards will be your best friends. Which is another reason why you want a very common vehicle, because parts will be easy to find and salvage yards will be filled with them.\n\nAvoid vehicles with special or luxury features. Anything unique or different means certain parts will be harder to find. You want the base model, no bells and whistles. Just standard package. The most common configuration they sold.\n\nAvoid european imports! It may seem like a good deal picking up an old volvo or volkswagen or bmw...but alot of those require specialized tools or diagnostic software or have complex disassembly procedures, and the parts are going to be expensive and harder to find.\n\nYou'll probably have the best luck with an old Honda or Toyota. Those arent hard to work on and everyone has parts for them. As long as you find one with a decent engine and transmission. Certain fords, gmc, chevys are great too, but you need to do your research first, to determine if the vehicle youre interested in has some kind of known serious fail point that's going to cost you alot of money and time. Figure out the average mileage that the transmissions and engines tend to last. I love domestics too, dont get me wrong. But old hondas and toyotas were just durable as shit and designed to be repaired by owners with basic tools. That being said I wouldn't trade my crown vic, f250, or astro van for anything.\n\nGet yourself a Bluetooth obd2 dongle. I suggest the Bluedriver, you can get it on Amazon for like $100. It will read and reset most codes. And you can keep it in your glove compartment for emergencies.\n\nDon't buy a vehicle until you scan it first!! Check for codes and if you dont see any, then run the smog readiness feature. If all of the monitors are not ready, that means they erased the codes on the vehicle recently, probably to clear a check engine light they didn't want you to see.\n\nThe dongle will also give you live data, and if your care throws a code, it will give you suggestions for repairs based on what others have done to resolve the issue whom have the same vehicle as you.",

You learn how to fix cars when they are always breaking down. Then I wised up and bought a reliable 94’ Honda Accord then a 96’ accord. Now I own a 2000 Toyota 4Runner. I use a downloaded pdf service manual and YouTube for repair instructions. These Honda’s and now my Toyota have been reliable and just need generally routine maintenance.\n\nI suggest buying a reliable vehicle like a Honda or Toyota and putting OEM parts into it as much as you can - they are superior to aftermarket auto store parts. Don’t buy a rusty car, and buy something reliable is my advice. Buy tools at Harbor Freight, get a good floor jack and jack stands and learn how to jack it up safely. Use ramps for oil changes, buy a torque wrench and tighten bolts to spec, learn how to do preventative maintenance.

A broken bolt in an inlet manifold can be an absolute nightmare to resolve. Good tools; socket set, open end and ring spanners. Never try and undo a bolt with an adjustable wrench because you don't have the correct tool. I have seen too much time dealing with a rounded off bolt. Start simple with spark plugs then go onto more complex issues. Get a multimeter and learn how to measure voltage. Get readings of what  your battery voltage is with the engine stopped and the engine running and record these for later.",

Just get a shop manual  (or digital equivalent) for your specific vehicle. That’s fine for basic maintenance tasks.\n\nBut for repairs, then you’re talking about diagnostics, actually finding the root cause of an issue. That is a whole other ballgame. It requires a pretty deep understanding of how everything works (including how different systems interact), combined with  a healthy amount of experiential learning or mentorship\n\nMisdiagnosing things gets expensive as you replace part after part without actually correcting the issue. .",

And I did plug it into my scanner and the live data was showing 67-72 psi (this was before putting in the new vacuum pump), I watched a video where it should only be around 10-12 psi, so would it just be the sensor?

Yesterday I was checking my oil level and the oil has a cream like colour I almost sh#t my self when I saw it but then I thought it could be discolouration from ceratec. The car runs and sounds fine the coolant tank is clean and it doesn’t smoke except a small puff on startup when it’s cold but I think that might be another issue as it’s been doing that ever since I got it so am I right thinking that it’s the ceratec or should I start panicking ? \nThanks in advance.",

I completely rebuilt this engine using genuine Toyota gaskets, new bearings and rings. I torqued everything according to ALL DATA, and had the block machined. The only thing left is the cylinder head. I installed a remanned head, but it should've been machined as part of the reman, it looked really good.\n\nWhat would you do in this situation?

They succumb to corrosion and first cause all sorts of weird running issues, then weird random fault codes and finally loss of electric drive. Toyota **really** screwed up on this car, there's a reason the Corolla Cross is outselling it the way it's doing and the XA60 was rushed into production.\n\nDemand they inspect the cables and connectors and show you the pictures, then post those pictures here and/or RAV4 World. If they tell you the cables need replacement, remember Toyota has so far refused to consider this a warranty job even on low mileage cars and has charged owners $6,000/7,000 for repairs. Toyota is under threat of several lawsuits, possibly a Federal investigation so they have opened an \"internal investigation\". Don't be afraid to raise all Hell if the dealership gives you a rap talk on how you must pay blah blah. \n\nI am sorry to bring such bad news but when Japanese companies try to save face we all lose... and get really pissed as well.",

        "selftext": "Hi guys, just wondering if anyone has any advice or shares similar experience. I have a Honda Accord 2.2 I-dtec 2008, 130k mile on clock (uk) and the clutch and flywheel was replaced at 97k before I got the car (got the paperwork to show this). The clutch has felt fine since I’ve had the car, smooth gear changes and no issues, I have noticed though that the pedal has a slight creaky metal sound when released at the top.\n\nI recently got the car remapped (supposedly a gentle remap stage1) and I’ve noticed now that when I press my foot to the floor in fifth the rpm needle will jump a few hundred rpm then fall back down and stabilise, I’m assuming this is clutch slipping. The clutch hasn’t done this prior to the remap, and seems to only do it in 5th when I put my foot to the floor mostly by going slower in higher gear\n\nAnyone had similar issue after remap? Or is it pure coincidence and the clutch installed 30k ago was either badly fitted or bad parts?",

Weirdly, if I turn on the blower (low) or headlights, it stays steady at 13.3–13.5v.\n\nIs it safe to drive like this if it holds in the 13v range under load?\n\nSo now I’m looking at:\n- Bad oil gasket\n- Maybe a bad ELD?\n- New battery (1 month old)\n- New alternator (1 day old)\n\nI’ve driven an hour using the blower trick with no battery light. Planning to take it to a shop next week for a deeper electrical/fuse box check. Any advice appreciated.",

I have pretty much replaced a lot and are still throwing the code. Just recently it seemed like all my actuators are going bad starting with knocking and my AC will give me heat but not air conditioning so I assumed that was the reason. Replaced my driver side actuator today and now my car will not start it will turn over but not start.. I am really starting to think that all of this shit going on has something to do with each other but I'm not quite sure why or how...  Any advice?",

                "body": "Just remember that multiple simultaneous problems are not necessarily related...\n\n\nThe P0172 just means there's too much fuel in the fuel/air ratio on that side of the engine, which can be caused by a lot of things, but the most common would be a faulty O2 sensor, fuel pressure regulator, injector, or a vacuum leak.\nIt can also be caused by low/no spark in a cylinder, but we would also probably see a cylinder misfire code in that case...\n\n\nWhen is the last time you did a tune-up? The easiest first steps to troubleshoot would be to pull your spark plugs to inspect them, thoroughly inspect your plug wires & fuel injector harness, check for strong spark on each plug, and once you get it started again, you can swap the upstream O2 sensors to see if the code switches banks, which would indicate a faulty sensor.\n\n\nAlso, if you can get it to fire with starting fluid, then it's definitely a fuel related issue, which will narrow it down a bit. 👍",

        "selftext": "I have a 2014 Kia Forte. Just pulled up to work only to get out of my car and see this absolutely MASSIVE wet spot under my car. I get on the ground to smell it, and it doesn't smell like oil. It's definitely all from my car as it hasn't rained yet today. And in the attached video you can see that there's little pipe/tube like piece where you can see it dripping from. Im extremely worried because I pulled up at about 8:30am and at 9:20am I was greeted by this sight after stepping out the car. \n\nIts the first time that it's ever done this. My only guess is that it has something to do with the AC. When I turn it up really high and turn the car off, I hear a squeaking noise for roughly 10-15 seconds. \n\nAny ideas? I know it's not a lot of info but that's all I have to go off of. ",

Very rarely have I ever done either fuel pumps for a no start. If it won’t turn over check battery first. Try jumping it. If it won’t jump check if it turns over by hand. Those had a tendency to burn oil and fouled oil clogged the left balance shaft screen starving it of oil and it would seize. If it turns over check the starter fusible link. With a voltmeter check from the positive jump lug to the positive on the alternator. You should have zero volts, this is a voltage drop test. Then check alternator positive to ground, should have source voltage (~12V). If that’s fine the starter lives in the right engine support, you should barely be able to see it under the turbo. Try giving it some light but solid whacks  with a stick while someone try’s starting it. If you now get a click it’s a bad starter.",

For one, you cannot use anything but AC Delco or GM and purchased from reputable source (Not eBay or Amazon) as there’s a lot of counterfeit ones. Second, they are very susceptible to damage so you need to test them, both for resistance and for producing a micro voltage when a knock is produced. There’s YouTube videos showing how. \n\nThe repair needs to follow the TSM with the holes they sit in being thoroughly cleaned of any corrosion or contamination from water intrusion (the leading cause for faulty sensors).  Then a small dam of RTV needs to be built up around the front of the holes to divert water around. \n\nI had to do this repair three times in my 01 Tahoe with 5.3 to fix the issue. First time was counterfeit sensors off ScAmazon. Then when I got the proper sensors from a reputable source, one was damaged and didn’t produce proper voltage. The final time I diligently tested each sensor, even had to swap out a few with the parts store because they were out of spec (likely dropped or damaged in shipping)\n\nNow my truck is doing great with no more check engine codes. It was a battle, but eventually I persevered.",

Replace the knock sensors with supposedly genuine AC Delco sensors. Codes resolved and returned after 100 miles. In a panic I spent forever tracing the engine computer wires and was having anxiety over a possibly faulty ECU. Everything tested fine, even the resistances on the new sensors.   Anyway, I took a gamble and replaced the AC Delco sensors with GM Genuine ones at nearly 3x the cost. The codes have been clear for thousands of miles. Long story short, get the GM Genuine sensors from a dealership. It is a lot of work to swap these sensors and its not worth having to do the job multiple times. The AC Delco sensors are not a OEM product sadly. They seem to stamp their name on products made by the lowest bidder. I will also add that the GM Genuine sensors had the same stampings as the original sensors on the truck, the AC delcos did not match. I wish you the best of luck and hope this helps!",

Which is just to say - the live data that is giving you isn't a whole lot of use as far as looking at the O2 sensors (especially the upstream ones), as it's just a snapshot. Usually we use an oscilloscope-style reading, where you can see the switching rates in real time, and whether it's biased one way over another. \n\nIn any case, if there are no other codes the basic approach is to rule out exhaust leaks, then replace the catalytic converter. You can replace the O2's as well, it's not a bad idea and they are comparatively cheap and easy to do, and if you're in doubt you can do the O2's first and then see if the code comes back. I've done that plenty of times for customers, though the cat code always comes back, in my experience.",

I can create the rattle when hitting rough parts of the road with the passenger side, but not the driver's side. Sounds like thick metal, not thin. \n\nSorry no picture, will add later. I have the wheels off and there isn't anything obvious. Nothing loose behind the wheels, used a pry bar to wiggle stuff. The rear attachment point for the lower control arm moves pretty easily up and down with the pry bar, so that is my suspect. The ball joint seems solid.  I also loaded the suspension to check as well.  Also nothing obviously loose in the engine compartment. \n\nQuestion:  should a just replace the lower control arm as a shot in the dark? Based on miles alone I'm thinking that's a good idea. I'd want to replace both sides at once, so I'd be committed to $300 in parts and time in my driveway.  I enjoy DIY car repair, so I'm good with that.  \n\nPossibly relevant: I've been chasing a puslation on breaking. Dial indicator on front and rear says no warped rotors. New rotors and brakes on rear. All caliper pins move well. Brake fluid changed 30k/2 yrs ago.\n\nAnything else I should be checking before diving into the Lower Control Arms?",

If you can get enough leverage from up top to push down on the vehicle repeatedly to simulate a bump, you might also be able to hear it - but on an Odyssey it would take quite a bit of force to do that and you may not be able to duplicate it that way.",

Recently, I started hearing a loud repetitive clanging noise from the engine. Turns out one of the bolts on the timing system – specifically the variable timing camshaft pulley on the exhaust side – had worked itself loose and was hitting the plastic cover.\n\nI called out a mobile AA mechanic who:\n\n* Identified the loose bolt (and another slightly loose one)\n* Retightened both\n* Applied threadlock to secure them\n* Said the clanging noise has stopped\n* Recommended taking it to a garage ASAP for a full inspection and to identify the root cause\n\nHas anyone had a similar issue with loose cam pulley bolts or timing components on a VAG/SEAT engine? What was the cause in your case — improper torque, worn parts, oil contamination, or something else?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences or advice on what to ask the garage to check beyond just retorquing the bolts again.",

One is power and the other is the ground signal from the ECM.  You can see if a parts store has a loaner set of noid lights.  You just find one from the set that fits the injector wiring connector.  Start the engine.  If the light flashes, then the injector is faulty.  If it doesn't flash, then the problem is somewhere in the wiring or the ECM itself.  You can also do this test by rigging in a 194 peanut light bulb.  Get two short lengths of wire.  Insert them into the connector terminals and attach the other ends to the bulb terminals.",

Turns out one of the bolts on the timing system – specifically the variable timing camshaft pulley on the exhaust side – had worked itself loose and was hitting the plastic cover.\n\nI called out a mobile AA mechanic who:\n\t•\tIdentified the loose bolt (and another slightly loose one)\n\n\t•\tRetightened both\n\n\t•\tApplied threadlock to secure them\n\n\t•\tClanging noise has stopped\n\n\t•\tRecommended taking it to a garage ASAP for a full inspection and to identify the root cause\n\nHas anyone had a similar issue with loose cam pulley bolts or timing components on a SEAT engine (is an Audi part)?\n\nWhat was the cause in your case — improper torque, worn parts, oil contamination, or something else?\n\nI don’t have any warranty. \n\nWould love to hear your experiences or advice on what to ask the garage to check beyond just retorquing the bolts again.",

But looking at the alignment report, I am not sure if the guy did a proper job. He only fixed the front toe, rest everything is almost exactly how it was before. He says whatever he could fix with the alignment has been fixed and for anything further, it would have to be mechanical rework as the vehicle as aged. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Are the angles small enough to ignore for now or should I take it to another shop for second opinion / another alignment?",

I read the codes and it ended up being 565 (CANP vavle failure) or in better terms and evap issue. my purge vavle isnt stuck open i am getting power to my harness and I'm assuming the canister is good. my filler neck is leaking which is an evap leak since it is all in the same system could that cause the crank but no start?? Also a 522 but i jumped the switch wire and it still wouldn't start so my only guess is the leak but hoping someone with a little more knowledge could throw some ideas or know at me\n\nI have checked everything else for the crank no start before I actually read the codes. fuel pump turns on I made a switch to bypass the relay, the inertia switch is bypassed, clean fuel filter, injectors working as the spark to plugs, voltage to battery while cranking, rebuilt the starter, fixed headgaskets and a few other things here and there. believe it or not SHE WAS RUNNING. She ran good for a while then i noticed things like backfiring, loss of power, rough idling and then she stalled and i havent been able to get it started since.\n\nany ideas with the information given?\n\nonly 57k miles also :)",

        "selftext": "So I have a 05 dodge ram 1500 5.7 hemi my engine light was on and blinking while driving home from work I stopped at a stop sign and went to go and the truck stalled out I keep trying to turn it back on it was cranking but not starting. So I had to call a tow and had them bring it to my normal shop to fix it mind you been going been going there forever but his son is taking over and now the shop is terrible… they called said it was the fuel pump and they put a new one in an said I was good to go. I go to pick up my truck make it a mile down the road and it stalls out. Called the shop obviously pissed they came and got it and and said the pumps under warranty and they would see what happen… two weeks later when they finally got to it they said it was a faulty pump and they replaced it and I’m good to go.. picked it up drove home noticed the engine light still blinking and some shaking when I hit 50 mph made it home and next day the truck is doing the exact thing again crank no start.. I just paid them $428 to do the pump an I feel like that was never the issue. With money being tight I couldn’t afford to bring it anywhere else or pay another tow so I’m trying to fix this myself. The codes it was throwing p0207 and p03000 and p0113 did some research and checked all my wiring to fuel injector 7 and replaced fuel injector 7 that didn’t work. Also checked wiring to the air temperature sensor and replaced air temperature sensor and that also didn’t work. Along with that I’ve tested the fuel pressure which is completely fine and I hear my fuel pump turn on so I know that’s not it. I also checked my fuses and fuse relay and that wasn’t the issue. I’m honestly starting to feel defeated and pissed that I paid these guys to fix the issue and I’m still here with a crank no start. Never going there again obviously and called and lost my shit on them cause I truthfully need my truck for work and my kids and feel like I got taken advantage of. If you’re still even reading I appreciate any advice of what I should do next or if anyone would know what could cause this issue.",

Just isn’t a easy task for me cause I’m 5ft and can hardly reach the back of the engine lol plus don’t really wanna buy them all to replace it if it isn’t 100% gonna fix my issue. Fuel pressure was at 50 psi yesterday from what I looked up seems normal. And I’m sure the fuel pump is aftermarket I wouldn’t be shocked this place has gone downhill sense  his son took over it’s sad to see. They were definitely rude and told me my truck was a piece of junk which whatever it’s been good to be over the years and definitely has a lot of life left just gotta pinpoint this issue.",

An impact gun of some sort. Cheap torque wrench. 6pt sockets instead of 12's to let you get harder bolts out without stripping them. Bolt extractor set. Torch. Puller, spreader set. Short sockets for spaces with limited clearance.\n\nThe thing with growing your tools at some point its just about efficiency.

My car is temp is running a bit high it reached 104c then went down to 94c and it went up a bit, when I parked it was at 102c I checked the coolant reserve I was surprised to see it become empty (it was full before i went out) no overheat light came on as well.\n\nMy car was running good before, coolant temp usually at 78 to 80c then the past few days it goes to low to mid 90s and now even higher.\n\nTo add, I was still able to get home without any issues (topped it off with the remaining coolant i had it was just enough to fill until minimum levels), just drove when traffic subsided the car without ac but car temp still reached 95c and i saw water underneath the car after it was parked.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm new to the forum and would really appreciate your help, as I honestly don’t know what else to do with my car.\n\nI have a **2012 Mercedes C250 Sport, 1.8L turbo**, and I recently replaced both the **engine and transmission** (the previous engine jumped timing and damaged the valves). The replacement parts are identical and fully compatible with the originals.\n\nBefore the failure, all the electrical systems and sensors were working perfectly. So, I reused **all my original parts** from the previous engine—spark plugs, coils, sensors, etc.\n\nI also made sure that all **grounds are properly connected**, both to the engine and the chassis. All the wiring and sensors appear to be correctly installed.\n\n**The problem:**  \nThe engine starts but runs with severe misfires, as if one or two coils were failing or not firing at all.  \nWhen I scan it with an OBD2 tool, I get **multiple coil circuit errors**, ignition faults, and low voltage to several components.\n\nI thought the battery might be the issue, so I **replaced it with a brand-new one**, but the problem remains.\n\nEach time I disconnect and reconnect the battery, one of these three things happens:\n\n1. The engine starts and immediately stalls (as if there's not enough voltage).\n2. The engine doesn't crank at all.\n3. The engine starts but runs with all the misfire issues mentioned above.\n\n# My question is :\n\nCould the **ECU have been damaged** somehow? Maybe from trying to start the car with a weak battery, low voltage, or a possible short circuit during the installation?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

It’s not a ticking or rattling noise, rather it’s a thud. Like someone had lightly dropped something in the engine bay. It doesn’t happen again when I start the car after it has been warmed up. I’ve seen a few posts similar to my problem, like it could be the starter / flywheel, but my engine is not making the same noise (could just be that my engine is different?)

Otherwise it will take many drive cycles for the car to self clear the fault.\n\nFor future reference, if you have MAF or fuel trim codes in the next weeks that keep popping up every so often or become a \"feature\" it's probably from the cai kit.  I've fixed more cars throwing those out and going back to stock than I've seen cars make actual performance improvements.  The original stuff flows more than enough well filtered air than a stock car needs in computer designed and managed flow over the sensors.  Cai kits tend to not filter as well (and often over-oiled) and are just random pipes as far as flow over the MAF is concerned causing an engine light.  A tune should fix that if you go that way.",

Before i try and buy a new alternator ,\n\nand also can a broken wire somewhere or a maybe a bad ground connection in the chassis cause this problem, knowing that the voltage and the resistance in the battery terminals are good ?\n\nthank you guys .\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dsaoyxxaup2f1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21d369426830490d710f8266c5297fa1f9941eb5\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hey guys. I just bought my dream japanese car, a 2002 Mitsubishi lancer evolution 7 GT-A. I got a new oil change, new transmission fluid, new spark plugs and the car runs and drives great. But since I got it, it has been running rough idle. There is no sign of misfire, just the car shaking alot including the steering wheel on idle and when stopped at a red light in drive. (You can hear the car shaking, its loud) The mechanic also said that I have compression rates of 100, 130, 130, and 130. So cylinder 1 is losing compression. I am quite literally terrified because  I have a a feeling thousands of dollars of repairs are coming to the engine. Head gasket has been ruled out, it could be a valve or a piston ring. (The car sat all winter and wasn't driven too much until I bought it, (previous owner cleaned fuel injectors recently)\n\n(I have not yet done a leakdown test because If I hear the results and its as bad as I hoped, I will probably regret everything but I will do one in the next 2 weeks for sure)\n\nAnyone have any ideas or help?\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm hoping for some guidance on a intermittent starting issue with my 2010 Mercedes A160 (W169). Automatic CVT gearbox, ~160000 kilometers.\n\nWhen I turn the key, all I get is a single click. It sounds like it's coming from either under the hood or the relay area in the front passenger footwell. There are no other sounds – no crank, no whirring. The dashboard is completely clear of unexpected warning lights, only shows the default set of indications typical for a not-running car, and my basic ODB-II app shows no error codes. Interestingly, if I pull the starter fuse, there's no click at all when I turn the key — maybe it's obvious, but adding this in case it helps to narrow something down.\n\nThe issue first appeared a week ago, then reseating the starter fuse helped, and the car started normally for several days. But later the problem returned, and reseating the fuse doesn't help anymore.\n\nI tried changing the car battery thinking the previous one was too old, but it didn't help. The voltage on the new battery is 12.3 V without load, dropping to 11.6 V when I try to start. Can this voltage still be too low? I thought if that were the case, the car would report that, but there were no messages on the dashboard.\n\nI checked and reseated all fuses; all seem to be OK. I reseated all relays (in the feet space of the front passenger), but did not check them as I didn't know how.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that with the ignition ON and with the brake pedal pressed it's not always possible to change a gear from P to, say, N (the gearbox is automatic CVT). I could not find some pattern in when I could or could not change the gear. Can a related sensor be causing the starting problem?\n\nWhat could be causing this seemingly intermittent issue? Is there anything else I could realistically check before I have to tow it to the repair shop? I'm really hoping it's not a faulty starter motor!\n\nAny insights or troubleshooting tips would be hugely appreciated! Thanks in advance!",

After putting everything back together and reinstalling the wheels, I noticed a **massive gap** between the tire and fender.\n\nI double-checked the installation—at least six times—to make sure the wheel hub was seated as high as possible on the shock. I also jacked up the hub before torquing down the control arms, sway bar, and tie rod, so everything should be under proper load.\n\n* **Image 1:** After the shock replacement\n* **Image 2:** Ride height before replacement\n* **Image 3:** Shows noticeable positive camber (which I believe was already there before the swap)\n\nThe old shocks were completely blown, but I reused the springs since they looked fine. I’ve driven the car around the block a few times, so I expected some settling, but the ride height still seems unusually high.\n\nDoes this gap look normal after a shock replacement, or is there something I might have overlooked? It drives fine, so I’m tempted to just leave it, but would it be wise to take it to a shop for a quick check-up?",

        "selftext": "I just replaced my gearbox and clutch (including a new release bearing), and also the engine oil and filter since it was about due anyway. Generally the van is driving smoothly, shifting well, etc. But when setting off from standstill, I usually get a clunk/knock/clack as I release the clutch and press the accelerator, as if something is loose or slipping. I can feel it through the clutch pedal (like someone is tapping the sole of my foot) as well as hearing it. It doesn't happen when only releasing the clutch, or when shifting through other gears, just when setting off in first. It started happening What should I be looking for? \n\nI got a similar issue, but worse, about a year ago. Occasionally, when setting off up a steep hill, the clutch pedal would violently shake/knock until the clutch was fully engaged. It wasn't the normal sensation of being in a gear that's too high; it felt like something was loose or slipping. Not long after, the clutch delaminated while trying to reverse up a steep hill, and the reverse gear itself had teeth ripped off it. I'm not sure that the current problem has the same cause, especially because I just replaced the clutch, but I don't want to wait till something catastrophic happens before dealing with it.\n\nThe left CV joint is leaking grease, presumably because I moved/damaged the boot when wrestling the driveshaft on and off to do the gearbox, but I don't see why that would immediately cause knocking (there is no sound when turning or accelerating). I'll jack it up and check if there is any movement in the wheels but I would be a bit surprised if that's the issue. ",

I was told it could be a bent push rod but the guy couldn't tell from the video. If it is rod Knock and not push rod noise. Is it worth rebuilding? I was thinking about a V8 swap I was thinking same gen LT1 if it's straight bolt in or LS swapping if it doesn't require much modification because I cannot custom fabricate anything because I don't know how to weld yet.

Yes shops are awful and they try to fix all kinds of things besides the actual problem. Acting like they can’t figure it out. It’s pretty bad. I offered money in the ad also. I don’t know if it’s because there are just too many inexperienced mechanics at shops or if they just purposely want to milk u for whatever they can before they are done with u. The trick is that u have to be good at judging if the person is honest or not. U have to be patient to find a mechanic that seems like they are not out to rip u off. U need to use best judgement to pick a mechanic who is honest. Which is not that difficult u just pay attention to how they behave and communicate well etc. A scammer is not that hard to detect if u keep talking to someone for a bit. Never send any money in advance to someone. Only pay once they are going to be fixing your car right then and there. Or after. A good mechanic will know exactly what’s wrong immediately or pretty quickly. And they will be transparent and show u what’s going on.",

You're going to kick yourself that you ever paid anyone else to do it. \n\nBatteries almost always warn you before they completely fail. You'll typically notice your car turns over more, i.e., is a little harder to start, when it gets near the end of its life, which is typically in the 3-6 year range (3 years is on the very low side but it sometimes happens that fast, especially in very hot climates). \n\nLearn how to monitor the state of your oil and oil consumption yourself. It's not rocket science. The level should be between the two marks on the dipstick, preferably nearer the full/maximum mark than the low/minimum mark. Darker = dirtier. Again, watch a couple of YouTube videos. There's probably one for your particular car. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations re oil changes unless there's some particular reason (e.g., something wrong with your particular car) to deviate from the recommended schedule. \n\nTransmission and radiator done for? Unlikely if you've been taking care of your car. That said, you should occasionally check to make sure no recalls or service bulletins have been issued for your car. Sometimes manufacturing defects occur. Reddit is actually a good place for keeping an eye on this stuff. Join the subreddit for your make/model and check in occasionally to see what other people are saying about their cars. \n\nIn the event there is something wrong with your car (or, as in this case, to get a second opinion on whether there's something wrong with your car), find a good independent mechanic. Don't use the guys at the quick oil change places for mechanical stuff ever. Shops like Firestone are kind of in between Jiffy-Lube places and real mechanic shops. They're good for tires and pretty good for brakes and some other relatively minor stuff, but be careful about using them for major mechanical work. (Some of them are decent; some are terrible.)",

As far as your transmission, that's pretty noticeable as well when something is wrong. The filters they typically ALWAYS try to sell you on unless they're clean with no dirt lol if you just had all of this checked 2 months ago you should be fine BUT to be safe take it to someone you trust to go over all of that with you. If you don't have any mechanics you trust what you could do I call a few places, explain what the oil change mechanic told you and most likely you'll find a place that's honest. \n\nTry to read up on basics so you don't ever let them get over on you!

                "body": "Likely has absolutely nothing with you being female. It sounds like it could be a difference in tolerance to “issues” by two different techs and how those recommendations are being presented by the advisor. A lot of this can live in a gray area of interpretation. While there are certainly greedy techs out there and there may still be shops out there that will intentionally try to take advantage of women, in my experience it is not the industry norm (ESPECIALLY when talking about taking advantage of female customers as a calculated move).\n\n1) Batteries WILL commonly fail testing even if you’re not actively noticing any starting issues at the moment. Two months can be more than enough time for it to go from testing good (albeit probably on the threshold of what is considered good) to failing testing. \n\n2) Depending on driving conditions and how dirty things like the cowl is, the amount of time that it takes for an air filter to appear dirty can vary greatly. With that said, just between oil changes does seem excessive. I’ve seen some guys feel justified recommending a filter if it has any dirt at all on it while others wait until it is in pretty poor condition. I’ve seen other guys not even check them and just use the scheduled maintenance table for their air filter recommendation. Personally, I don’t think that they should really be replaced until they are noticeably dirty with debris that won’t just fall out by tapping on the filter a few times.\n\n3) Two months is also more than enough time for a leak from something like a radiator or somewhere on the transmission to start and become detectable. It’s also very possible that, especially, if they are currently small leaks then the previous tech was not that concerned about them until they got bigger. Likewise, this tech may just have a lower tolerance for something like that and will recommend a repair if they see any leak at all. It is important to know that while it’s beneficial to fix every leak, not all of them NEED to be repaired as long as fluid levels are maintained. Coolant can be a bit of an exception to that rule. Because the cooling system relies on being pressurized to raise the boiling point, if the system develops a leak large enough that it reduces the systems operating pressure then the coolant can begin to boil. If it does start to boil then the overheating problem starts to compound because liquid coolant will transfer heat significantly better than gaseous coolant.\n\nWith all of that said, if you can’t confidently trust the recommendations then it may be worth getting a second opinion from a reputable shop that can actually assess the condition of the vehicle.",

                "body": "Here's how to check your battery yourself for 1/10th the cost of a mechanic looking at it:  \n\nThere isn't any risk to you or your car, the voltage from a car battery can't cross your skin.  Just make sure not to touch anything metal (other than the probes of the multi-meter tool) to the positive (+) terminal and any other metal on the car.  If you are just using a multi-meter and no other tools, it's basically impossible to short something accidentally.  \n\n  \n1) Go buy a cheap multi-meter from Home Depot, or off Amazon.  Something like this: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/AstroAI-Digital-Multimeter-Voltage-Tester/dp/B01ISAMUA6?crid=MZXS4TO741P&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0igT1Raq2QuSN2cSijNtPcSoCFfxOvx2OVUSjP30cWCl0z16D9qX_c98iLKaB0uq8LQGQQqBfGFuhYpbrniNBDbSsycyd-2193Zmkf4FWkM1rL4MbjIsWtwqbbhcsmiHf3DFk6Pt_r6CYKw66p-ZDXBUkepUNj3Fo2iHW3PKTvoLx-_C9ROZzWJJpQnUjvUWp4F09gbsLR3kOkdjoInPuSPXPDgFEtCjHTFFM4BW_sEQ8oHN9XAUIuGeXRI6fyoIbV6VyclWwwiBNmzERRdLsAmIIfN-IWT-6YgG_SpfgHs.o_8ce9zJAxa1fGIOydGegBQcH_gBqyRQJ19tPKUxUU8&dib_tag=se&keywords=multi%2Bmeter&qid=1748029461&sprefix=multi%2Bmeter%2Caps%2C155&sr=8-6&th=1  \n  \n2) With your car engine off, find the positive battery terminal either on the battery itself (usually it's marked with red plastic, and the symbol +) or in the engine bay.  Your car's owner manual will have jump start instructions and will show you where to connect the positive jump cable - it will likely look like a metal knob with a removable red plastic cover.  \n  \n3) Set the multi-meter to DC Volts (the symbol will be V _...)(Do not set it to V~, that's for AC current in your house).  If it has V _... 20, set it to that, that's the voltage range, 0-20 DC volts.  \n  \n4) Take the red probe and touch it to the + battery terminal or the + terminal in the engine bay, and at the same time, touch the black probe to the negative (black, marked with -) battery terminal or the metal body of the car.  \n \n5) You should see the mult-meter display read somewhere between 10 and 13 volts.  A healthy battery should read 12.4 - 12.9 volts.  \n \nNext...  \n6) Turn the engine on, and with the engine running, do the same test.  It should read above 13.5 volts.  \n \nIf it reads below 12.4 volts with the engine off, your battery is weak.  If it reads below 12 volts, you need a new battery pretty quickly.  \n \nIf it reads below 13.5 volts with the engine running, you need further diagnoses of your cars electrical system.  \n \nIf you google or youtube your car make and model and battery voltage test, you will get some pretty good instructions.    \n  \nBonus:  Once you have a multi-meter and read the instruction booklet on how to use it, you can diagnose a ton of problems with your car, your house, or any electrical device.\n \nIf you need more advice I'm happy to answer.",

Read. Your. Owners Manual.

Learn about your car. Learn what the components are called.\nA spot check brake pad thickness can be a trivial 1 minute task. Visual inspection for leaks only takes a short time. Inspection of tire tread is trivial. Fluid checks are super simple.\nTesting a battery takes seconds.",

                "body": "In general transmission fluid is due every 30-60k, depending on the car & the driving conditions. This is not one to trifle with if you plan to keep the car long term, but don’t do this at a quick lube place, get it done preferably at an Indy(Independent) shop or the dealer. Lifetime fill is bullshit, if they don’t list an interval for your car, follow 60k(unless you really beat on it, then do 30k).   \n\nAir filters are due every year, but for the love of god, do it yourself. The filter is like $20-30 and it can usually be done without tools, there are probably a bunch of tutorials on YouTube on how to do it for your car.  \n\nIf the battery hasn’t had a hard start, it’s probably fine, but if you want a second opinion, Auto Zone will check it for free.  \n\nThe radiator *should* be flushed at ~100k, but it’s really not a big deal to not flush it, just wait until the engine is cool, pop the cap off and check the level. If you do want to flush it, again, Indy shop, not quick lube.  \n\nPersonally I would avoid quick lubes like the plague. They pay bottom dollar and that’s the talent they attract. Too many people have had horror stories tied to a quick lube, wrong oil, forgetting oil, stripping out the drain plug, etc. an Indy shop might charge a little more, but that’s worth it for the piece of mind. And literally the only thing I’d even consider letting a quick lube do is the oil.  \n\nAll the intervals I’ve listed are general, the owners manual for your car should list what your specific intervals are. If you don’t have one, you should be able to find the intervals online on the manufacturer’s website. Just search “[car year & specific model] service intervals” and look for a link to the manufacturer’s website.",

                "body": "It’s probably ok but there are two specific situations it can go from ok to bad really quickly. First is it’s something that’s suddenly going to fail and drain the car of oil quickly. Loose drain plug, cracked rubber hose from say a turbo charger drain, or rusted oil pan. It’s minor until it isn’t. The second situation where it can be a problem is if it’s dripping on anything that gets excessively hot, mainly exhaust. Might be a tiny leak but if it’s dripping directly onto the catalytic converter there is always a small chance of fire. If neither of those apply you’re good, but I would recommend checking carefully to make sure.",

Since its been in there so many times I told them there is clearly a pressure issue and something is not right. I told them to run a block test. They claim they found nothing wrong, compression tested the motor instead of a block test as apparently to them this is a 100% way to rule out the headgasket, and just reattached the hose that popped off and refilled/bled the coolant system. Being skeptical I took off the radiator cap and had the car idle. Sure enough it starts bubbling. Technicians claim this is normal and it is because of the waterpump. They were very insistent that if it was a bad headgasket it would be the opposite issue, where there is no pressure in the coolant system and its flowing in the cylinders. Corporate dodge is involved now, and I have bought a block tester to go and see for myself if there are no exhaust gases in the coolant system. ",

It could just be coincidence they’re  busting around the same time because things are made so poorly and don’t last very long anymore. \n\nI dont agree with the mechanics that say the opposite will be happening and water flowing into the cylinders. They’re right and wrong about that. \nA blown head gasket can most definitely send bubbles into the coolant and it’s more common than the cylinder being flooded out by coolant. \n\nAnyways. If you had a blown head gasket you should be noticing performance issues, if coolant was making it into the cylinder you’d see some white steam blow out the exhaust especially on a cold start. \n\nI don’t think it’s a blown head gasket. Just my opinion. Compression test it elsewhere where they’re more transparent with you. Have them give you the compression numbers for all cylinders. If you see a big difference on the PSI then you really might have a head gasket leak.",

I saw it and thought \"this is shiny and has a vacuum line on it\" so I took it and whaddya' know. \n\nMy 1991 Ford Aerostar (3.0) only runs when I lightly pump the gas pedal, occasionally backfiring if I press any harder than a light tap. It's been sitting for over a year, but I flushed the tank and filled it with fresh gas. Same issue. So far I've replaced:\n\n-fuel pump\n-IAC valve\n-TPS\n-Fuel pressure regulator \n- distributor cap/rotor\n-plugs\n-plugs wires\n\nAll to no effect. \nI found the van for free on my town's Facebook page, and on that same day, someone gave another running, but severely rusted Aerostar to the town to be crushed. Since I'm one of my town's very few maintenance workers I have access to any parts from the rusty one. Seems like it was meant to be. As far as I know there are no vacuum leaks. Could this be timing related? I'm running out of ideas. I'm down to try anything. ",

When you need the spare, you’ll be thanking yourself for that.",

The AC worked PERFECT last year during the heat\n\nI got into a small fender bender in November last year, that only bumped into the driver's side of my car, just dinked up the front bumper is all. I haven't got it fixed since.\n\nSo, recently, Its been hotter! Who could've guessed? Anyhow, my AC is blowing warm air out, and when it does it makes a small whistling sound WHILE THE ENGINE IS RUNNING. I checked for any obstructions in the front vents, I checked my air filter (it's perfectly clean) and I topped off my coolant (Ive been told the coolant has nothing to do with the AC but it was empty so I still filled it up)\n\nIs this as simple as just filling up with refrigerant or is it something even more? Any help would be greatly appreciated!",

I would make sure the caliper's piston still moves fairly easily without getting cocked. I've only ever seen that be an issue once and I'm not sure how it happened, but the bore and piston on this car was worn enough to cause some strange issues.",

Then it went back to normal for till I came home for about 5 mins.\n\nI bought a pressure tester kit and there is no sign of leak. I left it there for 10-20 mins and the guage didnt drop. No leak as well. \n\nThere is no smell of coolant near exhaust, neithet I have got milkshake in engine, nor I get smoke in exhaust. So I assume head gasket is not blown. \n\nI do however have a lot of smell of coolant inside the vehicle and when driving I noticed time after time a hot air came from underneath touching my foot. \n\nWhat do you think it is? Thermostat? Waterpump? Heater core? Any guide would be appreciated. ",

        "selftext": "So, this past weekend my brakes went out as I was in a line of cars at a light. The light went yellow and the car in front stopped so I did too , but my brakes noped right the hell out and blew a line after about a second of braking. Smacked the car in front going about 4 or 5 mph. No noticeable bumper/radiator/fan damage.\n\nTowed it home, fixed all the brake lines and went to test drive and my motor or tranny makes a low growling noise when it is in any forward gear. Not when in park, neutral or even reverse. Drove fine, shifts cleanly with no slipping. I got it to 3rd gear in my neighborhood and the noise seemed to diminish with each gear higher, but I did not want to drive it much and possibly cause any more damage. Anyone have any thoughts?\n\nIt's a 6 cyl 2.6L (I believe? I can confirm if it's important). Has approx 222,300+ miles and the tranny is about 5 years old (refurbished).\n\nAny thoughts? Thanks so much in advance.",

Obviously make sure your compressor is cycling on, or it doesn’t really matter what your line pressures look like. Look at what the high and low side pressures are doing. If both sides have the same pressure, then your compressor isn’t compressing. Obviously it’s not a leak if the high side is saying that it’s got 150 PSI. If high side pressure isn’t bleeding into the low side when the compressor kicks off, you’d have a blockage. If the high side flutters, you’d have a bad valve in the compressor. I’d turn your AC off, and with the gauge hooked up to the low side like you already did, see if the low side pressure drops at all when you turn the AC back on. If it doesn’t, your compressor is bad.",

This is for a mustang GT 2002 and I've been using the supplied line's existing DIN style bubble flare, and since all my brother has on hand make double flares I decided to use that for the rest of the line. Every single time I've tried to make a double flare they would end up looking like the picture on the top, with sharper edges, pointing to the inverted flare, I'm not sure if that's quite correct but both connections look like that. But everywhere else I see on the internet they look like the bottom picture's double flare (3rd one), with a more thicker sidewall same with tutorials.   \n  \nI deburr the inner tubing and use the flaring grease before starting the flaring process.\n\nThe tool I used was a titan flaring tool but it has 2 sizes, but for some reason the box came with 2 3/16 dies. IIRC the other hole is has a bigger thread for 1/4. Will the top one hold or should I get another tool to get more of that rounded edge shape?\n\n  \nThanks.",

It's coming from the rear of the transmission and at first I assumed it was a leak from the pan, so I replaced the pan and the gasket. I thought it was good to go after that but then a couple days later after driving it around for a while I came back to park it and see it dripping again in the morning. Super frustrating so I took a deeper look and took a pretty good shot of it with my phone as well as a video to get more angles. In the video im behind the transmission looking forward so what you're seeing is the rear above the transmission pan etc.. I dont have the money or trust to take it to a mechanic so id rather diagnose and fix it myself. I think it could be the bulkhead sleeve, but also notice one of the hoses higher up seems to be wet, so im a bit confused. Any ideas? Oh and this is for a 4x4 2008 Ford Expedition XLT 5.4L.",

I'm pretty sure my rotors are warped, but even if they aren't, I still want to replace them since it's been 150k and just want some piece of mind.\n\nI saw some Advics \"high carbon\" rotors on RockAuto, and from my understanding high carbon rotors dissipate heat better. I do a lot of city driving, with lots of stop and go traffic. Would high carbon rotors be worth it for me? Or stick to OEM? They are roughly the same price (OEM are actually about $5 cheaper), so no price isn't a major concern. Thanks!",

However, when I start up my car to leave work, none of the audio (radio, bluetooth, media, etc) works. It has been doing it every day for the last week. The display works just fine but no audio comes out of the speakers. I've checked the fuses for both the multimedia system and the amplifier and they are fine. I've tested the connections at the fuses as well as at the amplifier with a multimeter and everything looks fine. I've also disconnected the battery for about 30 mins and reconnected it. Still having the issue and I have no idea what the problem is. I am tired of driving home in silence after work! Any pointers are greatly appreciated!",

I’m under the impression that it’s the front shocks (and I’m hoping it’s just the mounts). Is there a surefire way to diagnose this AND is there an easy fix that only requires some basic tools or will I need a spring compressor? Attached a video of the noise.\n\nThanks in advance 💪🏼\n",

        "selftext": "Hi guys. \n\nI have an 06 Outback, has run fairly well as long as I've had it. Only issue I had run into until recently is some squeaking when I'd first start the car and cut the wheel, seemed like the power steering was acting up. Stuck a little chapstick on the belt and it'd be fine for a day or so. The car drove, once I straightened out the sound stopped, etc. This is just background, just in case. \n\nI was driving the day before yesterday and the Brake, Battery, and ABS lights came on. A strong burnt hair smell became apparent. It felt like the car was lagging a little. The speedometer began cutting in and out, seemed like it'd drop flat when I hit about forty. ER IU and ER SP(The second one is just from memory) were coming up. I made it home, and then tried to start the car again. It was flat. My neighbor gave me a jump, but when I ran it for a second we noticed the battery was spurting a little battery acid. After that, I waited a few hours and later on decided to drive to Firestone to see if they could squeeze me in. About halfway down, the car started to die as though it were out of gas. I got it onto a side street, walked down to an O'Reilly's, got a new battery and 10mm, lugged it back and installed it. Car started right up, though battery lights was still on. Drove it home. \n\nGot up this morning and drove it to work, still okay. After work I drive it home and the same ABS battery and Brake lights come back on. After I get home, I wait about an hour and go to drive it around the block just to check. Same lights still on, clunk sound while I'm driving down the street and car jerked but it kept going, I turned around and came home. Turned the car off, then went to turn it back on and didn't even try to start. The lights inside, Bluetooth, keyless entry all were fine, but it wouldn't even click click click click when I turned the key. Came back about fifteen minutes later and it chugged for a sec then started. Turned it back off and tried again, flatline again.\n\nIs this the alternator? The belt? What's up?\n\nYour insight is valued greatly. Thanks. ",

I was driving to work this morning, getting onto the interstate, and my vehicle wouldn’t go above 50mph. Then all of a sudden my gas pedal just stopped working. I stepped down on the pedal and gave it some gas but it wasn’t working. I was able to safely exit the off ramp by Bluebonnet, and was stuck at that red light for about an hour waiting on a tow truck. I put my vehicle in drive and pressed down on the gas pedal and the engine would rev, but I wasn’t moving at all. I got towed to my mechanic, they were closed for Memorial Day, so I got towed to another transmission shop but they’re also closed until Tuesday.\n\nI checked my transmission fluid and it seemed to be fine. Am I going to have to totally replace my transmission? I drive a 2017 Tahoe with 164k miles on it. I had a friend recommend buying a tube of a chemical called Shutter Fixx and adding it into my transmission fluid. My friend had a vehicle that was having a similar problem to mine and he added Shutter Fixx and got another 4 years out of his vehicle before he had any problems. Does anyone have any experience with this? Any help or feedback is greatly appreciated, Geaux Tigers",

Every week. And I hear to occasional fireball pop from the exhaust. \n\nI know it’s not a car meet or anything cuz I can see the lot. \n\nI used to work on Hondas doing engine swaps and boost kits, cant think of any job that requires this much engine revving lol, drives me nuts. \n\nWhat do y’all think ?

It was missing a lug nut so I did some digging found that it was a 7/16 -20 nut. Found on. Put it on.all seems good. My step dad who used to work at like... Commercial T years ago. Is kind of freaking out because for some reason a 3/4 socket doesn't fit on this nut, a 7/8 is a touch big so the dude at the car part store said use a 21MM socket.\n\nStep dad is super confused as to why I have to use a MM socket for a standard nut. ALSO freaking out because the nut feels \"loose\" like a loose tooth until it gets all the way against the wheel. He is saying it should be tight after 3 threads. He's saying I need to not drive the car, need to go to a shop and have them look at the nuts, and Hub to figure out what's going on.. nuts are currently all tight and have been since I got the car. My dad has been driving it since 2016-17 restored...\n\nAny advice?\n\n",

A month ago, the check engine light came back on and when I went back, they ran a smoke test and said there were a couple of leaks and so I had them sealed. Now the check engine light is back on again and they've said that they'll have to replace the canister assembly and said that the part alone is gonna cost $1200. Feel like I'm getting played here. ",

Of course during the diagnostics they also found leaking head gaskets and more. The car only has 80,000 miles on it and is in great shape otherwise. But by the estimated repair cost, this seems like a necessary fix. \n\nI really love my car and I want to keep it, but I also want it to be safe. It’s the last manual transmission car I’ll own and I don’t wanna give that up. It would have a good trade-in value and people have been asking me if they could buy it, but this changes everything. I think I would like to know first if I shouldn’t be driving it and second if it’s possible to still get it fixed without breaking the bank. TIA",

Take a look at the auto parts store in your area just to see what they run. I'm just going to guess that the 35 series battery must go to a Nissan or small Toyota vehicle. And for the diagnosis, the way your service guy did it was a bit different than what I would normally do. But figure it in this way. For the time it took him to get to you, diagnose the issue, then get the battery and install it. He may have charged more than a typical shop at 0.2 hours at a rate that could be upwards of $175+ per hour, I would just say from your post, that you may have broken even when the two options are compared side by side. The convenience is what drives a business like mine to thrive. My company is known and trusted by many people in my locale. And we definitely would like for our clients to learn as much as possible to maintain their cars and trucks. But we know that can't always be the case when we are stranded away from home.

        "selftext": "Hi, we have just started the conversion of our Fiat Ducato 2014 L2H2 to a campervan.\n\nDue to the limited length and the fact that we are having an elevator bed, we are very limited to where we can install our roof fan.\n\nI'm contemplating if we can get away with cutting through the roof support brace that is placed right where we would like to have our fan.\n\nFrom my research, this support is not something structural that would affect the safety of the car if removed, and is there to prevent the roof from caving in and stop it from vibrating.\n\nOf course, I don't want it to cave inwards because that could presumably damage the water seal of the roof fan. So my plan if I were to cut through the brace is to add additional support(s) using sheet metal braces glued to the roof. See image #3 for an example of what I could build the new supports from.\n\nI have four options in mind for adding new supports:\n\n1. Modify the existing brace like my professional ms paint drawing in image #4\n2. Add a single new brace from side to side that mimicks the original brace in a place where it's not blocking the fan\n3. Like option #2 but to add two new braces on either side of the fan for extra support\n4. Move the original brace slighly towards the back. I'm not sure how to remove it though since it is glued in place.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Many thanks in advance",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone, I recently sold an 07 Pontiac G5 to my friend. About a week into his ownership, he called needing help. The key was stuck in the ignition at ACC and no power was in the system. No door locks, no windows, no radio, no lights, etc.\n\nI brought jumpers and as soon as I hooked it up the car got power back and cranked over easy as ever. Didn’t even struggle. It’s almost like the car shunted power, but wasn’t really dead.\n\nMy SDS code scanner only showed low voltage and comm loss across modules, but nothing else. Checked every fuse and battery connections, all good. Battery and alternator scan tool test came back in spec.\n\nBoth of us are confused, what could be the cause of this? If it means anything, there is one key and one fob, but the fob is dead. The battery is also only 4 months old.\n\nThanks",

All of the symptoms go away other than it does accelerate much slower with it unplugged. It’s like a completely different car.\n\nI suspect that I have some type of vacuum or exhaust leak after the MAF sensor but I can’t seem to find one. I have tried doing a smoke test, spraying carburetor fluid around the headers, etc. but I get no where.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions or tips? I just want to get this thing running right again. Any help is greatly appreciated.\n",

Sometimes it runs perfectly fine for days, then out of nowhere it just cuts out.\n\nSo far, I’ve replaced:\n\n* Alternator\n* Battery\n* Starter motor\n* ECU (car computer)\n* Brand new key\n\nMechanic says the car’s fine and gave it back after testing for a few days, but then the issue popped up again after 3 days of driving. The car shuts off with zero warning and then sometimes comes back to life hours later on its own.\n\nI’m seriously drained financially and frustrated. My mechanic basically told me to “check YouTube” for advice, so I’m guessing he’s given up. I'm about to offload it.\n\nHas anyone dealt with this or have any ideas what it could be? Any help would be awesome!\n\n",

I put in a new cv, control arm, ball joint, inner and outer tie rods and sway bar links. I have throughly inspected my struts and my sway bar and sway bar bushings and can’t find any problems with them and can’t recreate the noise prying on the sway bar and have no noise from the strut. I feel like I’m going crazy 🤪 if I can’t get it figured next stop the shop for the big bill, I do trust my mechanic very much just would rather save the money and do it at home. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated! It is a 2020 Kia sorento with 230 km I’m a high mileage driver",

Still losing coolant? \n\nRight after replacing it my heater went out, came back on the next day after driving like 20 minutes, i check the coolant and it’s nearly gone again. I refill it and after driving for a bit it’s gone again. \n\nWas told the heater thing was probably just air pockets that worked themselves out\n\nNow before I freak out, am I just not getting enough coolant in? \n\nI didn’t properly flush the system while doing the replacement (the bolt wouldn’t come off and I said screw it and let it come out of the lines since it was gona come out of somewhere anyway) \n\nSo I’m wondering if it’s just going through the system and I’m going to have to keep putting coolant in until the entire system is full and not just the res? \n\nMy car holds 2 gallons of coolant and I’d say I’ve only used half a gallon so far after replacing the pipe but my question is, wouldn’t it go through the system AS I’m putting the coolant in? Like I shouldn’t have to come back and put more in after driving right? I should be able to just continuously fill it up as I’m pouring it? \n\nTwo people I know are saying it could be a stuck thermostat which I’m not ruling out if anyone has any suggestions ",

It's very easy for them to get clogged. When they clog the water builds up and eventually leaks into the cabin. You probably have debris stuck around it or in the tube.",

        "selftext": "I recently (a few months ago) had my radiator replaced on my 2004 Toyota Camry, but after an hour and a half drive, I pulled in to hear my coolant reservoir bubbling / boiling. I noticed a small crack in the hose from the top of the reservoir tank to the radiator and am led to believe that was the issue.\n\nI purchased tubing at an O-Riley’s auto parts and I specified what it was for, but now that I’m back to my car, I’m wondering if it is just normal vacuum tubing or coolant rated tubing. I have included photos of both tubes and am wondering if it seems correct or if it is in fact vacuum tubing. The old tube has the electrical tape on it where I was going to wrap it before I bought the new tube.\n\nYou can see where there was a leak on the top of reservoir when it was boiling (overflowing) out. There is also a little bit of dried coolant near the (radiator?) cap, and a lot below the crack in the tube.\n\nThe old tube didn’t look like it was lined specially with anything, but I just want to check if the new one will work for me.\n\nI have also purchased Zerex Asian Vehicle 50/50 to replace the lost coolant (Toyota super long life pink coolant). \n\nAny help on this would be great!",

        "selftext": "Any ideas or suggestions welcome. Got an issue with our 24 Hours of Lemons race car and have a race coming up in June. Panic mode engaged. Here's the book, apologies for the wall of text. \n\n  \nThe Car: 2008 Chevy 2.2 HHR manual transmission 24 Hours of Lemons car. \n\nThe Problem: No fuel pump prime, no crank, no start. Code P0230 - Fuel Pump Primary Circuit\n\nBackstory:\n\nOriginal engine was tired, probably only making 70 HP so we swapped out for an engine we built, dubbed it the Frankentec: 2.4 block with a 2.2 head. Correct reluctor wheel was installed to match the crank position sensor. All electronics and sensors were moved from the old block to the new. Truly, the only difference is the block, head, crank, and bearings. No electronics of any kind were new to the build, everything it is using was present before.\n\nOnce the new engine was built up and installed, we pulled the fuel pump fuse and ignition fuse, figured we'd use the starter to kick the engine over a bit and build up oil pressure before starting the new motor for the first time. With those two fuses pulled, the starter engaged and cranked the engine. We pulsed it, letting the starter cool down in between sessions. Did that maybe 5-6 times.\n\nWe put the fuel pump fuse and the ignition fuse back in and everything changed. No more crank, we do not hear the starter gear fire, all we hear is the throttle body butterfly valve flap open. When turning the key the dash goes dead for a second, then comes back, fuel level shows up and CEL, P0230.\n\nWe pulled the fuses again, to see if we could get back to the starter firing, but it's still doing the same thing, just the flap of the TB butterfly valve. No crank, no fuel pump prime.\n\nBeen over this thing like crazy with the multimeter and relay testers. All fuses, every single one test good, even if they have something to do with this or not, I've tested everything. We have 12V coming in to pin 30 of the fuel pump relay and ground on pin 87 is good, tested to a couple ground points and even all the way back to the negative terminal of the battery.\n\nFuel pump fires when jumping pin 30 to 87. Fuel present in rail, the schrader valve lets some out if you test there.\n\nFuel pump gray wire does not get 12v when trying to start the car, only when jumping the relay. All four pins on the fuel pump test back to ECU harness good, no broken wires. All three pins on the fuel pump pressure sensor trace back with no issue as well. Getting 5v on the pressure sensor between pins 2 and 3.\n\nOn the fuel relay socket, we're getting approx 2v (1.9 something) on pin 86 on the relay. Wiring between the ECU connector and pin 86 tests good. Haven't pulled the ECU connector apart yet to backprobe to see if 2 V is coming from the ECU, but I'm planning on doing that too. 2 volts seems super odd to me, but this is my first deep dive into troubleshooting car electrical issues. Also going to use the backprobe to make sure that all ECU grounds are present as well.\n\nCrank relay is getting 12v on pin 30 as well, ground checks good on 87. Pin 86 gets 9v and 85 is good to ground.\n\nWe've swapped relays around just to make sure, no change. Verified pin 30 on all the relays are lined up to 12v hot, don't think anything is flipped upside down.\n\nHad the battery on a trickle charger the whole time, even tried with jumper cables hooked to my daily driver, no change whatsoever.\n\nWe used HP Tuners to disable VATS and the requirement to have the clutch pedal pushed in to start. ECU writeback went fine, no errors. Security light does not come on. Anti-theft module still installed and wired up. Pulling anti-theft wiring connector near keyhole results in security light on dash but no other changes. Pulled the ECU tune again to verify that the changes we made were truly written and they were, saw them correctly set in the tune we pulled back off of the car. Ignition switch recall has been done.\n\nIt's wild. Any suggestions on where to look next are greatly appreciated. Going to order an ECU/PCM and BCM off of eBay, will see if those make a difference. I was assuming that HP Tuners would have an issue writing to the ECU if there was an underlying problem, but maybe not. Maybe it's only hitting the main EPROM and if there's an internal short to ground somewhere else on the board it would only impact things if the car tried to run. Don't know, pretty new to this but trying to figure out what I can. Also going to go through the whole ignition circuit to verify everything is good there, and I'm potentially going to remove the race car kill switch and wire power back to stock config.\n\nNext steps:\n\nBackprobe ECU to verify grounds as well as the voltages between ECU, relay pins, and endpoints\n\nVerify starter circuit\n\nVerify ignition circuit\n\nECU swap\n\nBCM swap\n\nLight car on fire?

He quoted me 5-7k for parts and labor but he said he has to get me a real quote when he looks everything up so that’s just an estimate. Is that reasonable? Should I just get this and that fixed at that mileage? I’ve seen used engines with warranties for 2100-3000. Is that a good price? All suggestions welcome.

It's about 150k miles, so I wasn't expecting a dream machine here, but I was at least hoping it'd last me a year or two. \n\nThe thing that really bugs me, is this is very similar to the previous problem of my Kia Soul which I mentioned earlier.... so if this is a common problem, is it something weather related? Am I just.... driving wrong? Or just really bad luck..... I'm not sure. \n\nJust any help would go a LONG way, because this REALLY sucks. ",

My mechanic is coming to look at it. The vehicle is in great interior/exterior condition. With the mileage so high, should I consider a new engine? He quoted me 5-7k for parts and labor but he said he has to get me a real quote when he looks everything up so that’s just an estimate. Is that reasonable? Should I just get this and that fixed at that mileage? I’ve seen used engines with warranties for 2100-3000. Is that a good price? All suggestions welcome.

Unfortunately it happens wayyy too often and the design in these cowls are not great. I would recommend not to glue it down as when your windshield breaks/cracks and needs replacement, whatever you use to glue that down will just be null as they need to take the full plastic cowl piece off your car.\n\nThat being said. You can probably buy that weather strip piece on the front of your plastic cowl for fairly cheap and apply it on there after removing the older piece and gunk where it failed. There is also this stuff from 3M called “Adhesive Promotor” and it works like a charm for keeping moldings and weather stripping pieces where you want them to be. Advise wearing latex gloves while working with the adhesive promoter pads. \n\nOtherwise, the cheap option that will surely fail again, maybe quicker, would be to buy some sort of butyl tape and just send it.\n\nEdit: grammatical error",

Parked the car at my house, pressed the button under the unlock on the aftermarket fob (top one in picture), and the car tried and failed to remote start. I then pressed the \"1\", and then the alarm starts blaring. The only way to turn it off was to lock it with the aftermarket fob. Now, the toyota fob sets off the alarm when locking/unlocking and doesn't stop until turned off and locked with aftermarket fob. Seems to be fine when only using aftermarket fob, unlocking and locking with it allows me to drive without alarm. Dealership has no idea why it's doing that and hadn't run into the issue themselves. Any idea whats going on? The remote start seems to also be aftermarkt.",

It softens the harder deposits which then break off and clog oil passages, caused oil starvation and complete failure. If you want to clean your engine, change your oil more often.

A loose chain should have been rattling and you should have noticed a difference in the engine noise when you picked the car up.  That said, if you DID notice a difference, the chain needed to be replaced anyway, and you just took care of something that needed to be done -- chalk that up to preventative maintenance.\n\nBe fair to the tech.  If the fix reduced engine noise, it needed to be done ... Even if it didn't fix your fault.\n\nIf the engine sounds the same, be a thorn in the side until he makes it right, or fixes the real problem for the fault (which you never shared with us).",

Tensioner in Z14XER is spring loaded and even when there is no oil pressure, chain should not be that loose.\n\nI hate this engine to be honest, even more than I hate Z14XEP. In order to change the tensioner, you need to remove side cover. When you have that removed, you are about 7 bolts from changing whole timing set (sprocket wheels, chain, tensioner, guides), which you need to remove to replace fancy cover gasket anyway. If I would see chain that loose, I would change it as well, whole timing set probably. Intake cam position sensor in these engines goes bad quite often, that will cause P0011 as well. Variable timing is controlled with oil pressure, I would probably start diagnosis with measuring oil pressure, then I would check cam position sensor, then check variable wheels for any play or damage as these will also make noise and cause timing errors.",

I’m not sure if acorn nuts would be a better choice to keep saltwater out.  \n\nI hope this doesn’t violate a rule. I posted this believing it’s a relevant question that a mechanic can/should answer.

More than 30 mins of city driving and 6 or so minutes idling? The short-term fuel trim is normal I guess.

        "selftext": "So I recently replaced my CV axles with an after market brand GSP. Ever since I had them replaced I’m getting almost like rough binding/ shuddering when the steering wheel is full turned to the left or right. I tested the issue on an open lot and when turning at low acceleration it feels like I’m running over speed bumps on the side of a highway. Also I replaced my control arm and tie rods. But it feels like it’s the CV.\n\nMy question is, I went back and looked at the specs of the GSP CV axel, on the driver side compressed length is 24.53in. The GM Genuine compressed length is 20.46in. Same with the pass side. GSP is 21.97in and GM is 17.94in. Do you think the difference in size can be causing my issue or can it be more and be a tranny issue. I purchased them off Rockauto and made sure it was for a 3.6.\n\nI had my mechanic look at it and try to replicate it on the lift and had the front end hanging. But couldn’t get it to do what I’m explaining. It’s only happening when it’s under load. If anyone has any thoughts or input on this if would be appreciated.",

        "selftext": "I have a car such as Audi a3 1.4 tfsi 2013 cmba 122hp ea211. There is a pretty slow coolant leak I think into engine or spark plug hole. Water pump has been changed. \n\nThe head gasket may need changing.\n\nThere is oil leak through the piston rings so those need changing too. There is blue/grey smoke out of the exhaust.\n\nthe stronic gearbox is clunky when shifting down gears. I think that flywheel and clutches would need changing soon. This has been quoted at £900 for the parts and labour of this. \n\nI managed to get a quote for £1.7k including labour  to change pistons,rings, head gasket and injectors(part not included) \n\nThe car is on 110k miles\n\nWould it be worth so I could keep the car for 2 more years?\n\nPlease advise on this.
